1,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/avatar-fire-and-ash-movie-review-james-cameron-finds-himself-between-technical-brilliance-and-creative-stagnation/

""Avatar: Fire and Ash leaves me with mixed feelings of technical admiration and creative exhaustion. It's a film that lives off its scale, scope, and technical audacity but fails to take the step forward the narrative required to become memorable on its own merit.

Cinema cannot just be a technology demonstration; it needs characters whose journeys we feel as our own, themes that are explored in depth, and stories that aren't limited to repeating past successes. There are fascinating ideas here, from Neytiri's grief to Kiri's divine isolation and Varang's antagonistic beliefs, but they're lost under a cynical structure and unjustified plot decisions that make the experience truly frustrating. The lack of clarity about the fate of certain characters and the stagnation of some arcs make me fear that the next movies will follow the same path.

James Cameron is an undeniable visionary, but he seems to have forgotten that for a flame to keep burning brightly, it needs new fuel and not just the ashes of yesterday.""

2,2,Review from Khushdave,"One of the first things that stood out to me was how feminine this film felt in the best possible way. Almost every major female character holds power, agency, or authority: the Tulkun matriarch, Ronal, Tonowari’s clan through Ronal’s influence, Kiri, General Ardmore, Varang, and especially Neytiri, who finally gets the screen presence she deserved after the first film. Across clans and factions, women clearly hold more power than men, and that thematic choice felt intentional and refreshing.

Visually, the film is absolutely staggering. The massive set pieces are some of the most impressive James Cameron has ever delivered. Bridgehead City and the Cove of the Ancestors are jaw-dropping, and for the first time since the original Avatar, I didn’t feel that uncanny disconnect between live-action elements and CGI. In The Way of Water, Spider occasionally felt like he didn’t quite belong in the frame. Here, that problem is gone entirely.

The human technology continues to be absurdly cool. The submarines, aircraft, ships, and industrial machinery are all terrifying and fascinating in equal measure. Cameron still knows how to make humanity’s tools of destruction visually seductive.

Kiri and Spider’s bond is finally made official, and that storyline is one of the film’s emotional cores. Spider, in particular, benefits enormously from the increased focus. After spending much of The Way of Water sidelined, he steps into the narrative in a big way. The sequence where Kiri gives him the ability to breathe Pandora’s air is genuinely suspenseful, even when you can guess where it’s going.

Lo’ak’s arc is one of the biggest improvements from the previous film. I wasn’t a fan of him in The Way of Water, where he often came across as reckless without understanding the consequences of his actions. Here, his growth feels earned and deeply affecting. His suicide attempt was shocking in the moment but makes painful sense in hindsight. Jake handles Neteyam’s death terribly and places much of his grief and blame onto Lo’ak, becoming an emotionally absent and often cruel father. Seeing Jake finally tell Lo’ak that he’s proud of him is one of the most satisfying moments in the film.

Varang and the Ash People are genuinely terrifying antagonists. A Mangkwan warrior becoming a suicide bomber to take down a Windtrader ship is one of the film’s most chilling sequences, as is the scene where they sever Na’vi kurus. Varang herself is a standout villain. Her rage is rooted in loss and starvation, in a childhood shaped by destruction and abandonment. She doesn’t believe Eywa will save anyone, and her trauma drives her toward annihilation rather than healing. She’s compelling precisely because she’s so damaged.

Quaritch continues to be one of the franchise’s most interesting characters. He evolves from insisting he’s “not that man” into slowly accepting himself as an upgraded continuation of his human self. Jake’s words to him during moments when they’re not actively trying to kill each other clearly get under his skin. His dynamic with Varang brings out the worst in both of them, but it feels more like a relationship of convenience than genuine bonding. Quaritch increasingly feels like a ghost with unfinished business, driven by an imprinted need to destroy Jake Sully even when it no longer serves him.

The scene where Jake is captured and put on display by the humans is incredibly effective. The voyeuristic curiosity of the crowd makes it feel suffocating, like you’re trapped in the box with him. Jake’s words to Quaritch in that moment are chilling.

Neytiri’s return to center stage is another highlight. Her scene freeing Jake is pure catharsis, reminding us why she remains one of the franchise’s most powerful figures.

The film works extremely well as a direct continuation of The Way of Water. There’s no need to pause for heavy exposition, and while that might frustrate some viewers, it reinforces the feeling that this is very much Part Two rather than a standalone chapter. In that sense, Fire and Ash retroactively strengthens The Way of Water, which ended in a somewhat unfinished place.

The revelation about Kiri feels inevitable and satisfying. She is a clone of Grace’s avatar, with no father, and appears to be Eywa incarnate or at least its physical manifestation. The choice to give Eywa a face that resembles Kiri reinforces that idea beautifully.

That said, the film is not without its flaws. Several major plot beats feel like rehashes of earlier films, particularly the final battle. Humans walk into an ambush, the Na’vi initially gain the upper hand, are overwhelmed by superior firepower, Eywa intervenes through wildlife, and the climax ends with a personal duel between Jake and Quaritch, this time with Spider as the third presence. Kidnappings also remain an overused narrative device.

Many side characters suffer due to the film’s ambition. Tsireya, Ronal, Tonowari, Aonung, and Rotxo were essential in The Way of Water, but here they’re largely sidelined. Rotxo’s death, in particular, feels underdeveloped and somewhat cheap. Ronal’s arc is disappointing as well. She’s mostly reduced to being pregnant and eventually dying, despite her strong presence in the previous film. Tonowari is barely given anything to do at all.

The Windtraders are another missed opportunity. David Thewlis’s Peylak is barely present, and the group disappears from the story far too quickly. It’s unclear whether Peylak is even alive by the end, and that ambiguity feels unearned.

There’s also a recurring issue where entire groups of characters seem to vanish during major battles. Just as the Metkayina disappeared during the climax of The Way of Water, large numbers of Na’vi seemingly evaporate here, despite clearly being alive in the aftermath.

Norm and Max fare slightly better than before, but the bar was extremely low. Given the lore revelations around Norm having a Na’vi family, it’s frustrating that this isn’t explored further.

The ending feels less complete than The Way of Water’s. Important reactions and consequences are missing, such as Tsireya and Tonowari learning about Ronal’s death, the fate of remaining RDA soldiers, and how Quaritch, Varang, and the Mangkwan escape. While Spider’s acceptance into Na’vi society is emotionally satisfying, it doesn’t fully compensate for the unresolved threads.

Looking ahead, there are many compelling questions. What happened to Quaritch and Varang, especially given Varang’s visible fear of Kiri? Is Ardmore alive? Who is “the Chairman” that Selfridge references? Was Garvin recording Jake’s imprisonment, and could that footage be used to expose the RDA back on Earth? Why does Eywa have a face, and why does it look like Kiri? And how long can Quaritch realistically remain the central antagonist as he drifts further from human command?

Spider’s future is particularly troubling. Neytiri tries to kill him multiple times across the last two films, and Jake attempts to ritually execute him. His question, “Do you still love me?” is heartbreaking. He desperately wants a family, yet both of his parental figures nearly murder him. His bond with Quaritch only complicates things further, creating emotional whiplash that feels intentional and painful.

Overall, I loved Fire and Ash. It’s beautiful, emotionally effective, and ambitious to a fault. It tries to juggle too many characters and storylines, and some inevitably suffer for it. Like the original Avatar, this film would benefit enormously from an extended edition with restored scenes. It barely feels like three hours, which suggests a significant amount was left on the cutting room floor.

Fire and Ash works best when viewed as the second half of The Way of Water rather than a standalone film. Together, they form a richer, more coherent narrative about grief, responsibility, and resistance. Even if Avatar 4 and 5 never happen, I hope we at least get extended editions to fully flesh out what’s already here.

Despite its flaws and It may not tell a particularly unique story, but it tells it beautifully, and the emotions land exactly where they’re meant to.",9,2025-12-19 16:08:19,2025-12-19 17:06:04
3,3,Review from Dean,"I give it 5/10 because, this 5 stars are for technical side. Movie has amazing effects, especially if you're watching it in 3D. It's visually beautiful, however I'm not giving rest 5 stars because of its narrative and agenda. Movie portraits us - humankind as evil, conquering race and simply bad. Yes, sure, we humans made a lots of mistakes in the past and we're not perfect, but we're not that bad and we do a lot of great and kind things as well, but people in Hollywood (those liberals) want us to hate ourselves, to feel guilty, to say how bad we are. Those people who push this agenda, they're obssessed with self-hatred and humilation. They're the one who want to divide people. We even hear in movie how those tribal aliens are calling us ""pink-asses"" and how they hate us. I think we all know what's happening here folks, it's a same leftist narrative and their propaganda.",366,2025-12-20 11:47:06,2025-12-20 11:47:06
4,4,Review from Dave,"The first film is a classic  and really made 3D movies a thing again. This one brought back that magic just like the original in that it was another roller coaster adventure. The score was terrific, almost as good as the first one.  The vibes are dark, dark, and emotional, but strong character builds made for a fantastic plot line execution. Disney fan service was notably fine-tuned and props for that one. The level of real-world issues is turned up to the max, similar to Cameron’s big ones  (Terminator, Aliens, Titanic), but an epic trilogy just like the original Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, so tons of strong biblical and spiritual tones.",854,2025-12-23 11:46:44,2025-12-23 17:20:31

""The Great Flood ends up being a bittersweet experience, promising an immersion into the human soul in the face of the abyss, but floating only on the surface of several ideas without truly diving into any of them.

It benefits immensely from the talent of Kim Da-mi, but it's pulled down by a script that can't decide if it wants to be an action blockbuster or a philosophical essay.

An ambitious project that forgot to solidify its emotional foundations before opening the floodgates of scientific complexity.""

6,5,Review from MovieGuys,"""The Great Flood"" could have been the most remarkable disaster movie I've ever seen and indeed, on a certain level, it still is.

This film successfully marries up the comfortable, if messy, normality of everyday suburban life, with a, by degree, increasingly terrifying disaster. It starts slowly, with heavy rain but then we see water building to oceanic levels, outside tall South Korean apartment blocks, topped off by horrifying giant waves, that quite literally, shatter the illusion of a safe and predictable future.

Viewed from this perspective this film is simply stunning. Topped off by superb, sensibly understated but nonetheless emotionally girpping performances, from the talented cast.

As another reviewer aptly points out, the departure from this script, is where this film comes up short. Indeed, an ""essay on morality"" and maybe humanism, is the perfect description of what this film tries to achieve in its second half, but never quite gets there. 

Its biggest problem is it does not set the stage for this sudden transition in its story, in a concise or convincing, manner. You might also argue it could have achieved the same emotional outcome, by simply furthering, the initial premise it so compellingly established. 

In summary, ""The Great Flood"" is a film of two parts. The first part is amazing, the second half muddies the waters, dissipating a message, about what it means to be truly human, it was already well on its way, to making.",470,2025-12-20 21:19:48,2025-12-20 21:22:25
7,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Twelve years after they dazzled us with their magical skills, the “Four Horsemen” are mysteriously reunited and joined by an enthusiastic young trio who bring some new blood to their most difficult challenge yet. Someone wants them to bring the wealthy “Veronica Vanderberg” (Rosamund Pike) to her knees, but the only way to do that is to pinch her enormous diamond. Needless to say, this is kept in an ultra-secure vault and this one is also buried deep in the Arabian desert. Before they can even think on appropriating this gem, the cocky “Atlas” (Jesse Eisenberg) has to learn to get on with the even more sure of himself newbie “Bosco” (Dominic Sessa) whilst all seven, gradually, proceed to try to work together and decrypt the secrets hidden within a French château that has more than it’s fair share of secret passages and surprise residents. Meanwhile, this infamous stone has another would-be owner, who is attempting to blackmail the money laundering “Veronica” with some information that she might not want public. With no shortage of people trying to steal the thing, what happens next…? It has some moments, this film, when the pace really picks up and the visuals deliver some quickly paced feats of illusion that are quite entertainingly and usually acrobatically presented. In some ways, it also serves to debunk some of the myths of these theatrically deceptive arts, but sadly these scenes are too few and far between. There’s just way too much dialogue, and not enough vanishing. To be fair to Pike, she does look the part and her South African accent just about stays the course; Sessa, Justice Smith and Ariana Greenblatt deliver fine as they breathe new life - and a little map humour - into old props, but Harrelson hams up too annoyingly, Dave Franco just models his beaming smile and small T-shirts and Isla Fisher isn’t really on screen often enough to make very much difference to a story that is dragged out as if it were being paid, scene by scene, by a tourist board or some luxury product placement. It isn’t dull, and the production is way more highly polished than her jewel, but I think the sleight of hand filming techniques that maybe worked in 2013 are less effective now that we all know CGI can render the impossible, possible. Harmless fun.",865,2025-11-15 14:40:15,2025-11-15 14:43:36

""Now You See Me: Now You Don't undoubtedly asserts itself as the most solid entry in this trilogy, raising the technical bar and finding new life in the reinvigorated dynamic of its cast.

However, all the superficial shine and aesthetic improvements fail to hide a script that confuses complexity with complication, delivering characters that function merely as pieces on a formulaic board. It works as light entertainment, but it's insufficient to fully justify its return to the big screen.

It invites us to look closer, but unfortunately, the closer we look, the less we see the depth it promises, leaving only the fleeting glow of a well-rehearsed trick, yet empty of true magic.""",143,2025-11-27 21:31:00,2025-11-27 21:31:00

11,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"I must admit that I’d entirely forgotten about “Sisu” (2022) until I sat down to watch this, and then it all came flooding back. Maybe that is because this isn’t so very different. He (Jorma Tommila) has returned from his native Finland to his former home in what is now Soviet occupied Karelia to collect it. Yep, he is going to dismantle the wooden home he built for his murdered family and relocate it across the border. The Soviets still remember the carnage he caused last time around, and so release his erstwhile tormentor “Dragunov” (Stephen Lang) from a gulag with instructions to terminate him and earn his freedom (and lots of roubles). What now ensues is like a militaristic game of snakes and ladders as “Sisu” faces soldiers, armoured cars, fighter planes and even a train as he tries to stay alive long enough to make it home with his logs. Now I don’t think there is even the slightest hint of jeopardy here, indeed it pretty much screams the continuining adventures of “Sisu” from the start, but it’s really good fun if you like mindless violence, a good old-fashioned baddie straight out of an Ian Fleming novel and loads of combat scenes that would easily have killed him, and just about everyone else, a hundred times over. Ever seen anyone somersault a tank? There is a bit of dialogue, but it’s entirely unnecessary as the bullets fly and the blood flows, and we build to a denouement that almost makes you cry! This production has seen considerable effort gone into it, there’s gore galore and I did quite enjoy it for ninety minutes.",313,2025-12-11 17:46:16,2025-12-11 17:46:16
12,5,Review from MovieGuys,"""Sisu: Road to Revenge"" is a polished case of ""style over substance"" with a predictable, anti-Russian message. 

All the trappings are there. Excellent sets, spectacular cinamatography, at times entertaining, if over the top action and capable acting, from the cast. What's missing is anything that truly looks like a intelligently rendered back story. What made the first ""Rambo"" film work so well, putting the intense action aside for a moment, was a truly heartfelt back story, with a character, who, at least for one film had personal depth, that was wholly relatable, wholly ""human"". 

This film aspires in this direction, early on and looks like its could get there but quickly devolves, into what feels a lot like a ""Call of Duty"" style, computer game, where you kill everything in sight, until there is very little left, not only to see but, in this case, to empathise with. The director and writers, try to reignite the emotional component, of this film, at the end, with the house building scene but by then, any emotional potential, has long since departed.

In summary, this film is a platform, for a mega-ton of over the top, at times viceral, gritty, action but that's as far as it gets. Looking beyond the superficial death and destruction, it's disappointlingly shallow. An okay watch.",575,2025-12-18 06:22:29,2025-12-18 06:31:19

Rating: A-

""Zootopia 2 asserts itself as a worthy and even necessary sequel, overcoming the natural loss of the novelty factor with a narrative that dares to dig deeper into the imperfect foundations of its utopia.

Although the mystery doesn't reach the suspenseful peaks of its predecessor, the film makes up for it with dazzling visual evolution, a voice cast in a state of grace, and a mature exploration of the partnership between Judy and Nick. It's a movie that entertains as much as it provokes thought, refusing to offer easy answers to complex problems like historical erasure and social exclusion.

More than just a simple animated adventure, this is a story about the responsibility to remember and correct, inspiring us to believe that building a better world requires the courage to look back so we can, finally, move forward together.""",355,2025-11-26 21:34:44,2025-11-26 21:34:44
14,9,Review from BryanGreyson,"Very short: Zootopia 2 is lovely and has as many little details about the world and everyone within it as the first one. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this one.

Longer:
Zootopia 2 basically does what the first one already did: Using the story of a police case to teach people, inside and outside of the movie, that prejudice and stereotypes we learned to believe are often wrong and even more often dangerous. In addition, it also features other themes like stolen land, and that ultimately what makes ""you"" is your decisions in the situations you're dealt.

(Important) moral of the story aside: Zootopia 2 is as beautiful, maybe even more, as the first one. Such beautiful colors, so many moving parts and animals, such great detail on soft surfaces and, of course, fur.
Thanks to that, Judy (and the others) look even more beautiful and detailed with so many individual hairs and such awesome effects when things get wet.
The same applies to stuff like water in general, snow and sand.

Like in the first movie, so many little details are shown in the world: How different species work together, how different sizes and skills are used and how buildings and facilities are built to accommodate all the different species.

Emotionally the movie is also as lovely as the first one: Many jokes, Judy's overly positive optimism and Nick's cynicism do the same job as in the first one. Only this time the movie actually goes and deals with how both of these traits of them are also used to mask their emotional weakness and how they deal with them. (Although I personally feel Judy gets off the hook a little easy, but well, details.)

And, as is proper after the first one, there's also at least one tear-jerking emotional part.

So, I recommend that movie. The ""police story"" in it, I think I actually preferred the case from the first movie. But that little bit aside, characters and details are equally as lovely.

I recommend it, and I'm looking forward to Zootopia 3!",734,2025-11-29 22:36:13,2025-11-29 22:36:13
15,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Things are not looking so hot for this animal equivalent of “Dempsey and Makepeace” after one of their clandestine operation goes especially pear-shaped and the boss threatens to split up “Hopps” and “Wilde”. The former is probably the more professional of the two and after discovering something distinctly scaly at a grand civic reception that goes wrong, allies with her foxy partner to get to the bottom of a secret that might involve a grandma, a patent and a seemingly harmless metal-covered journal. Meantime, the local bigwig lynxes seem determined to thwart these detective activities, so we have to assume that their status as town grandees isn’t what it seems - but with everyone sceptical about our dynamic duo, what chance they can get to the truth? Aside from just being quite an enjoyably paced adventure, this also has a bit more substance as a story that shines some light on prejudice and stereotyping. That’s done in an entertaining and under-the-radar fashion, but it’s still quite clearly illustrating the “never judge a book by it’s cover” philosophy as well as taking a pop at good, old-fashioned, greed. The detail in the production is often the source of more for the adults amongst the audience, and there’s quite a bit of humour for all ages from the dialogue and the tea-time menace that gradually accumulates amidst the snowy mountain tops. The quality of the animation, particularly the facial expressions but also the acrobatics, is entertainingly colourful with plenty of daft antics to test the loyalties of friends old and new. Maybe “Zootopia” isn’t quite as it seems? Maybe it never was? Good fun.",311,2025-12-04 10:22:57,2025-12-04 10:22:57
16,5,Review from MovieGuys,"I can but question the underlying messsage offered up in""Worldbreaker"". If there was a war and all the men were used up, who would fight? This film pushes a tale where women should ""step up"" and ""save the world"". Its a message that coincidentally fits in with the current Western establishment's narrative about the ""threat"", from the likes of Russia and China. A threat that has little basis in fact but could still be seen through to fruition, if they advance a war mongering agenda. Of course too, there actually are not enough men in the West to conscript, so who's next in line?

Putting aside one possible interpretation of this films narrative, how does it stand up? Frankly, its rather slow. It takes far too long to go anywhere and when it does, its not overly inspiring. The upsides includes quality acting from the cast, which ranges from capable to truly excellent. Creature effects are convincing too but they never feature, that prominently. 

In summary, what is this film actually trying to say? Perhaps my interpretation is wrong? I certanly hope so. Looking beyond this consideration, its a rather slow sci fi survivalist thriller, that is only held together by sterling acting, from the main cast.  A marginal watch.",826,2025-12-20 04:31:02,2025-12-20 04:48:07

""The Running Man falls short of the potential that Edgar Wright and the source material suggested, though it's an efficient vehicle for the talent and charisma of Glen Powell and presents themes that could and should be incisive.

Its narrative repetition, unnecessary exposure of its messages, and unsatisfactory ending prevent it from becoming a memorable dystopian thriller. It's competent and perfectly acceptable entertainment, but it lacks the impact and significance it promised.

18,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"With his young daughter in need of some basic medication that he and his wife cannot afford, “Richards” (Glen Powell) sets off to enrol in the most taxing of television game shows. If he can stay alive for thirty days, he will win a gazillion new dollars and be able to live, with his family, like a king. Of course, he learns fairly quickly that this will never be a fair fight as the show’s boss “Killian” (Josh Brolin) makes quite clear. This is going to be brutal stuff, with the population actively encouraged to report his whereabouts for a cash bonus, so the goons or the “hunters” can come and waste him. Now he isn’t exactly your average ye-ha ninja type. He’s more your decent, gym going, family man - so what chance he can adapt and survive in the face of betrayal and bullets? It starts off quite promisingly, and as usual Powell is fully aware that much of his appeal on screen is down to his willingness to wear (nor not) a skimpy towel, but once we get into the adventure proper this all reminded me too too much of a “Hunger Games” production - complete with remote television cameras and exuberant live television coverage from “Bobby T” (Colman Domingo). There’s a blink and you’ll miss it cameo from William H. Macy which could have been delivered by just about anyone and if you’re especially eagle-eyed you might spot Sandra Dickinson here as she and Michael Cera attempt to provide our runaway with some much needed moral support. “Richards” accrues cash for each kill and for each day he survives, and that also reflects the level-up, video-game, style of these adventures with each getting more lucratively perilous and him becoming more like John Wick as the days go by. The sense of menace? Well that doesn’t really survive an increasingly relentless sequence of predictable CGI-driven pyrotechnics and it just possible that Powell isn’t the best casting here. He’s easy on the eye and charismatic, but he isn’t convincing at any stage as things heat up and neither are Brolin or Domingo who just overact. It could readily lose half an hour without compromising the gist of the original Stephen King story and I just couldn’t help thinking it was released too close to “The Long Walk” which is similar in concept and better in delivery. It’s watchable enough, but I’m not sure I will remember it any more than Arnie’s more static, studio-based, version from 1987.",522,2025-11-13 18:10:20,2025-11-15 20:11:45

20,5,Review from MovieGuys,"There's often a very good reason why they say a film is ""adapted"" from a literary work. 

Such was the case with the 1988 film, ""Running Man"". Ably adapted from Stephen Kings literary work, it condensed a much longer tale, into a manageable and entertaining package. 

Regrettably, what has been repeatedly touted as an advantage, that is the new film, following the literary work of King more closely, is anything but. This is an overly long, at times thoroughly boring film, that's lacking in both pace and direction. Worse still, its narrative is devoid of depth and wit, leaving  characters who feel more like caricatures. Unsurprisingly too, its woke. Who didn't see that coming?

The net result is a film  I personally found so tiresome and dreary, I ended up rewatching the thoroughly satisfying original, to cheer myself up.

In summary, overly long, lacking in pace and direction, narratively impoverished, populated by card board cut out caricatures. My advice, if you are new to this tale, watch the 1988 original. Its leagues ahead of this burnt offering.",245,2025-11-19 20:50:23,2025-11-19 20:52:14
21,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/wake-up-dead-man-review/

""Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery exceeds expectations by diving into a darker register without losing the layers of humor and captivating mystery that define the franchise.

The howdunnit mechanics become unnecessarily complex before the climax, but given the brilliance of the whydunnit — exceptional character work and rich thematic exploration — every minute is a valuable experience.The witty banter between Daniel Craig and Josh O'Connor, coupled with the depth of their discussion on what it means to ""believe,"" is one of many proofs in this sequel that a whodunnit doesn't need to be perfect to be a resounding success. Rian Johnson offers a worthy continuation of the saga, surpassing expectations by delving into a somber register.

The truth may be winding, but in this mystery, faith and forgiveness are the biggest plot twists of all.""

22,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Pugilistic priest “Fr. Jud” (Josh O’Connor) has lost his temper with a deacon and been consigned to a remote country parish where his plain-speaking bishop (Jeffrey Wright) hopes he can do less damage. Upon his arrival, though, he realises that this is quite an eccentric little congregation led by the mildly megalomaniacal “Monsignor” (Josh Brolin) and his ever so slightly menacing factotum “Martha” (Glenn Close). The new arrival isn’t universally welcome, especially when he tries to impose his own more religious approach to parish affairs, and then somewhat out of the blue, the older churchman is mysteriously killed. Of course, “Jud” is the obvious suspect but the arrival of the Poirot-esque “Benoit Blanc” (Daniel Craig) to help with the investigation soon reveals that just about anyone from this tightly knit community had some sort of axe to grind. It also transpires that there’s a missing eighty million dollar fortune, a bit of illegitimacy, a secret romance and even an acid bath to be factored in, too! It’s Cluedo on steroids! Brolin reminded me of Kris Kristofferson the whole way through as his behaviour gets wackier and more manipulative and he does gel well with an O’Connor who’s clearly having some fun as the plot thickens nicely, and suitably convolutedly. I could have done with a little more from Miss Close, and neither Andrew Scott nor Jeremy Renner really have enough of the plot either, but the writing and pacing of this quirky and personality-driven mystery keeps it quite enthralling in the best tradition of Agatha Christie as it mixes some good old fashioned detective work with some provocative religiosity; technical wizardry and even a little biblical mythology. Don’t be put off by it’s lengthy duration, it’s the best of these “Knives Out” tales so far.",99,2025-12-11 18:52:41,2025-12-11 18:55:25
23,5,Review from MovieGuys,"Its amazing what you accomplish with a creative script, even on a limited budget. 

""War of the Worlds"" isn't going to win any awards but  its nonetheless still quite entertaining. 

The notion of the whole alien invasion playing out from the control room of a US NSA surveillance agent, is novel, as is the manner in which everything is nicely brought together. The acting  is decent too, so no complaints there, either. 

Perhaps the only limited downside is the special effects, which are only passable. That said, they still function well enough, to make the whole thing enjoyable. 

In summary, a simple but watchable sci fi experience. A nice distraction for a wet weekend.",702,2025-07-31 05:52:34,2025-07-31 05:56:21

26,13,Review from r96sk,"<em>'War of the Worlds'</em>... boy oh boy. I've been out of the film loop recently, but word of this disaster even reached me. I had to check it out for myself to get it watched before I got spoiled. Sometimes the internet piles in to jointly overhate a movie... this is not one of those times.

What a mess, there are sadly no redeeming qualities to it. First and foremost, it takes itself way too seriously. There are (I think) a few jokes scattered in there, though they last for literal seconds - everything else is played straight. It had a better chance of working as a comedy, albeit barely.

The initial novelty of the ""screenlife"" (never knew that was a thing until now) set-up is kinda interesting, though it very quickly wears off completely. It ends up getting annoying, especially the constant calling noises - almost gave me a headache. It'd work as a short, not for 90mins!

The computer stuff looks quite awful too, the most boring and least creative way of utilizing the whole PC concept too. They literally just zoom in and out for the entire flick. There is one scene where they do the <em>'Jaws'</em> dolly zoom effect, which is minorly cool to be fair.

There is also a piece of photoshop right at the end that is hilariously bad, I'm pretty certain I could do a better job... OK, maybe not, but you know. The whole ending had me chuckling (negatively) at the film, with that aforementioned moment but also with that flying delivery thing.

I've got this far into this (overly long) review without noting the acting talent. It has a few good names attached, but none of them do anything remotely standout - but, in fairness, have barely anything to work with. You could place any world leading lad or lass in this and it'd be the same.

Ice Cube... I'm gonna let this one slide, because I do like him. Same goes for Eva Longoria. Both of 'em are, erm, not good though. The only actor I'd give a tiny solace of praise to would be Devon Bostick (Rodrick to you and I), who has one scene where his teary eyes look kinda convincing. As you can see, I'm reaching!

I don't know what's worse. This movie, or the fact that I've just typed up seven paragraphs about it. We're both as bad as each other! This only avoids the bottom rating from yours truly through comparison. Incredibly, I have seen worse.",513,2025-08-17 12:32:15,2025-08-17 12:32:15
27,14,Review from Chandler Danier,"I once watched Jake Gyllenhalle talk on the phone for 1.5 hours and I hated it. I watch Ice Cube squint at a screen and chat with friends and family for 1.5 hours and I love it.

Data! They're coming for data. They're going to eat all our data! Why not just copy the data? Why not just set up a separate server farm where they just make an infinite RickRoll for the aliens. There is technically unlimited data if you copy that data forever and if the aliens eat the data, does that mean there's space for more data on that hdd? If you could write the read spead of the aliens, you could just give them unlimited data off of some small device. That could keep them eating for a while and while they're distracted, you set up a nuclear bomb inside them that is on a timer and they could prevent it from going nuclear but doing so will cause them to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.

Anyway. I like how this movie is shot. It is ridiculous and stupid. I happen to find it charming.",95,2025-08-20 20:33:15,2025-08-20 20:33:15
28,15,Review from kevin2019,"""War of the Worlds"" draws inspiration from both ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""Open Windows"" (2014) amongst others to create this current interpretation of H.G. Wells's classic 1898 novel. The fundemental message of the book - humans are in reality nothing more than a vulnerable race even now in the 21st century despite our overwhelming dependence on the technology-driven infrastructure we use every day - remains the same, but it is indeed ironic this technology should be used to assist in the telling of the story. The problematic drawback with this technique lies in the fact it is like watching a live action video game and the unfolding drama surrounding the dilemmas and traumas the various characters we are supposed to care about are enduring quickly becomes desperately abstract as any global disaster inevitably does when it is reduced to being nothing more than television news feeds and the deceased are merely a list of numbers on a screen. The resulting film only manages to scrape the surface of the characters and the devastating invasion itself to create the illusion of reality without the necessary emotional depth required which only genuine characterisation can provide for it to truly resonate with an audience.",175,2025-10-04 13:19:48,2025-10-25 22:59:34

Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is simply excellent! The movie delivers incredible visual effects that keep you on edge from start to finish. I literally jumped 11 times, which shows how well the horror atmosphere is handled.

Compared to the first film, this sequel is much better: more intense, more immersive, and with an amazing ending that truly surprised me. The actors are outstanding, fully bringing the story and the tension to life.

For me, it’s a solid 8/10.

31,18,Review from MontyTG,"**Weaker than the original film but entertaining.** 

As a massive fan of the original film, and would go as far as to say it's a misunderstood masterpiece. This slightly disappointed me. The runtime was way too short for a film this ambitious, and it doesn't seem to know what to focus on. It feels like subplot after subplot that barely progress the story until the final act. Then it rushes through everything with an ending that feels abrupt. It's a shame because the Marionette/Charlotte plotline is brilliant, the final 30 minutes are chaotic and entertaining, and the Toy animatronics are given justice. Overall, a really entertaining time with an incredible score, but the story needs more attention.",444,2025-12-07 16:15:50,2025-12-07 16:15:50
32,19,Review from LegendGamerXZ,"I think this movie is what a FNAF Movie should be, way better then the first, it really dives into the horror, it’s also a bigger film, the cinematography has dramatically improved, and so many Easter eggs that the diehard fans will catch on, but some you will miss in a blink of an eye. The animatronics were awesome and that is thanks to the Jim Henson Corporation. The voices were very well done as well, if any of you were doubting Megan Fox as Toy Chica, she did well. It sounds like Toy Chica and also made it her own, and MatPat’s voice was very unrecognizable as Toy Bonnie. Kellen Goff was amazing like always. My only real gripe was the movie is really fast paced and it could have benefited with a longer runtime, and some of the writing and dialogue delivery was pretty wack in some parts of the film. That ending tho, it ended with a big cliffhanger and stay for the post credits, it’s insane. This movie is a huge improvement compared to the first movie.",312,2025-12-07 17:33:41,2025-12-15 05:30:38
33,20,Review from IMDB,"My Review of FNAF 2
Honestly, the movie was absolutely incredible, especially for long-time fans of the franchise. I jumped more than nine times — no joke — and the special effects were on another level. The animatronics looked terrifying in the best possible way, and the actors did an amazing job bringing the story to life.

On the downside, the plot can be a bit hard to follow at times, and some moments feel a little confusing if you’re not familiar with the lore.
But overall, it was a thrilling experience, packed with tension, atmosphere, and fan-service done right.

I’d easily rate it 8/10 or even higher. A must-see for any FNAF fan!

34,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Luckily it isn’t actually five more nights at home with the pizza loving bear, but it still felt like it took an age to get to a conclusion that you could have seen from space. “Abby” (Piper Rubio) is missing her now defunct animatronic friends whilst elder brother “Mike” (Josh Hutcherson) is having one of those will they/won’t they dalliances with “Vanessa” (Elizabeth Lail). It’s while this latter pair are on a particularly awkward date that she sneaks out and visits the surprisingly accessible derelict old amusement park, where she sits and pines for her lost pals. It seems, though, that the malevolent ""Charlotte” hasn’t quite finished with “Abby” and using “Chico” et al as doting conduits, she manages to formulate a cunning and brutal plan that will see her take revenge on all the neglectful parents out there whom she blames for her own grisly demise back in 2022 (or last year according to the plot). It speaks volumes when the “and” credit at the end is for Matthew Lillard, and I guess JH can’t have had his advance for next year’s “Hunger Games” prequel yet, else why would he get involved with this derivative plod of a movie. It’s scripted and delivers like a mediocre video game that relies on nostalgic tokens to charm it’s audience and though there is some quite entertaining gore occassionaly, the whole thing is an entirely unnecessary sequel to a film that had precious little originality to it in the first place. It could quite easily lose half an hour with no impact on it’s story and I can only pray that we won’t have to spend any more nights with these clunking clowns - battery powered or not.",346,2025-12-11 18:16:34,2025-12-11 19:38:52
35,21,Review from ezra,"mixed feelings! i really enjoyed it and brought a lot of cool stuff to the table, but felt really disconnected from the worldbuilding in the tron legacy affiliated media.

this last month or so i've been going through all the canon tron media and obsessing over it. i really do have a love for the franchise. most of the people i went to see it with, who didn't put in the same amount of preparation, really enjoyed it, one said they liked it more than tron legacy.

anyway! the scenes and ideas in it were really cool, the action scenes were well done from a technical standpoint. although i don't feel like the action had too much emotional weight like they did in legacy.

i feel like it's not really a tron movie without the flynns, alan and tron. and that's where my disappointment really comes from is that it's about completely different people who never existed in lore prior to the film. it never contradicted the lore and there were callbacks and light nods, but it really just wasn't the same without the characters fans fell in love with. also i wish they had done more with the isos, the isos were a big deal to flynn and there's so many cool things they could've done with them.

i'm also disappointed with the casting decision for jared leto, his performance was fine but as a person i don't exactly hold him in the highest regard, which made it difficult for me to look at his face the whole time like that. some of the pacing felt really campy, comic relief in weird spots from characters who really served no purpose. this issue didn't exist in either previous film which really took me out of it this time.

scoring was great, trent did a great job. overall the film was very enjoyable and i would recommend for people who enjoyed the first tron film or legacy. but if you're a superfan, don't expect anything too spectacular.",844,2025-10-10 04:58:27,2025-10-22 17:36:48
36,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"If a movie franchise has nothing especially new to say about itself or its mythology, perhaps it’s best if it refrains from trying to say anything at all. Such is the case with this latest installment in the “Tron” series of would-be sci-fi screen epics, a nondescript, underwhelming effort that, regrettably, disappoints in myriad ways. What starts out as a generally unengaging tale about AI corporate espionage that straddles life in the real world and cyberspace improves somewhat as it moves along, particularly in the back half when the connection to the original 1982 release becomes more apparent (and more compelling). But what precedes that development is uninspiring, even if it is visually dazzling to look at. Its attempt at conveying a cautionary tale about the potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (not to mention the greedy, dimwitted purveyors of this dubious technology) may be laudable for its nobility and sincerity, but it’s not especially new at this point given the many other cinematic releases that have already tackled this subject (and better), perhaps best seen in several of the “Terminator” offerings. Arguably, the biggest problem here is an anemic script that generally tries mightily (though not always successfully) to link this picture’s narrative with its seminal roots, but it frequently feels as if it’s reaching for a suitably sufficient tie-in. That’s particularly apparent where a key story element is concerned, one that has been alluded to in previous installments but that is brought up directly this time – and that should have played a far more significant role in this iteration but that, sadly, is largely glossed over when introduced, receiving only scant treatment thereafter. The casting also leaves much to be desired, with gifted character actor Jared Leto being thrust into a part where his performance is about as appealing as a lukewarm bowl of porridge (with few prospects for greater, more meaningful depth and development); protagonist Greta Lee turning in a portrayal lacking in passion, interest and realistic believability; and Jeff Bridges essentially making an extended cameo that he could have just as soon phoned in (though, thankfully, Jodie Turner-Smith and Gillian Anderson are on hand to breathe some much-needed life into the otherwise-lackluster acting). Interestingly, this offering boasts an impressive original score by Nine Inch Nails, but its presence is so undeniable that it often tends to overpower the action that it’s meant to complement (I often found myself listening more intently to the background music than to the on-screen dialogue – an element that really shouldn’t be that obvious). To be honest, I can’t say that I hated director Joachim Rønning’s latest feature outing, but I certainly didn’t love it, either. In fact, the only reason I’d recommend seeing it on a big screen would be for the special effects, and, if that’s not justification enough for you to plunk down your hard-earned money for theater ticket prices, I’d suggest waiting until it comes to streaming and watch it at home.",458,2025-10-12 00:06:34,2025-10-12 00:06:34
37,23,Review from Johan,"**SLOP**

I can't believe people are actually saying it's good. Tron 2025 is completely boring, derivative, and predictable. The casting choices are absurd and it looks like a Netflix or Disney show aimed at pre-teens. Also, I guess crappy acting performed by crappy actors is standard for post 2020 Hollywood.

I just don't understand why people love eating this slop, and then they clap like seals for the slop, it's baffling.",159,2025-10-12 02:22:19,2025-10-22 17:35:52
38,16,Review from misubisu,"##A Visually Stunning Sequel That Plays It a Bit Too Safe

The Grid awaits once more, and its return is a welcome one. *TRON: Ares*, the long-gestating next chapter in the cult-favourite franchise, delivers exactly what the trailer promises: a breathtaking dive back into a digital world of light-cycle duels and identity-disc battles. It’s a spectacle for the senses that faithfully honors the legacy, even if its human heart sometimes gets lost in the neon glow.

**The Visuals and Sound Are the Real Stars**

Let's be clear: this film is worth the price of admission for the aesthetic alone. Building on the foundation laid by *TRON: Legacy*, *Ares* pushes the visual envelope even further. The Grid feels more vast, more detailed, and more dangerous. The signature light-cycle sequences are more visceral and intelligently choreographed, and the disc wars have a satisfying, weighty impact that will please fans. The real standout, however, is the sound design and score. While no one can truly replace Daft Punk, the new musical team (or rumoured guest artists) have crafted a pulsating, electronic heartbeat that seamlessly blends nostalgic tones with fresh, aggressive synth-wave rhythms. It’s a triumph.

**A Compelling Premise with a Rushed Execution**

The story follows Ares (a perfectly cast Jared Leto), a powerful A.I. program sent from the digital world into our human reality—a clever inversion of the first film's premise. The goal is one of peace and understanding, but as any *TRON* fan knows, nothing on The Grid goes according to plan. The philosophical conflict—what happens when a perfect digital consciousness confronts the messy, illogical nature of humanity?—is fertile ground.

The film is at its best when exploring this core idea. Leto brings a compelling, otherworldly quality to Ares, making him both empathetic and intimidating. However, the screenplay struggles to balance its high-concept themes with its blockbuster obligations. The human characters, including a weary corporate tech executive (played ably by a under-utilised Jodie Turner-Smith), often feel like narrative devices to move the plot along rather than fully fleshed-out people. The third act, in particular, rushes toward a climactic battle that, while visually spectacular, resolves the film's central philosophical dilemma a bit too neatly.

**A Worthy, if Flawed, Entry**

*TRON: Ares* doesn't reach the iconic status of the original nor the cult-cool heights of *Legacy*. It feels like a carefully crafted, slightly safe attempt to reignite the franchise. It does so with immense style and a clear love for the source material, but it stumbles in giving its human elements the same depth and complexity as its digital ones.

**The Verdict: 7/10**

*TRON: Ares* is a solid and entertaining sci-fi adventure. It delivers stunning visuals, a thumping score, and enough classic *TRON* action to satisfy devotees. While its story doesn't fully explore the profound questions it raises, it successfully opens a new door to The Grid, leaving you hopeful and eager for the next round.

**See it if:** You're a fan of the franchise; you crave a big-screen visual and auditory experience; you enjoy high-concept sci-fi, even when it prioritises spectacle over depth.
**Skip it if:** You demand deep character development from your blockbusters; you have no prior connection to the *TRON* universe.",634,2025-10-12 10:24:27,2025-10-12 10:24:27
39,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Oh dear! After “Morbius” (2022), I had hoped that Jared Leto might pick better, but after about ten minutes into this overlong and repetitive adventure I am afraid that proved not to be the case. Named after the Greek war god, he is a sophisticated computer programme that makes the “Terminator” look like “Barbie”. Virtually indestructible, he can penetrate any security system and therefore could prove to be invaluable to the military. Meantime, at a rival technology company they are working on the one thing that has thus far evaded all of the developers. Permanence. No matter how clever their inventions become, corporate nasty “Dillinger” (Evan Peters) knows that after half an hour their creations turn into Lego. He knows that rival “Eve” (Greta Lee) might be onto a solution and so he plonks “Ares” and his kick-ass sidekick “Athena” (Jodie Turner-Smith) into their system and so a cyberspace battle-royal ensues that tests the mettle and the “humanity” of just about all the players. I say players because that’s what this comes across as for much of it’s computer generated existence. Unlike the first “Tron” film from forty-odd years ago, this has very little by way of story and relies way too much on the, admittedly impressive, visual effects and high-octane pace of the thing rather than making any real effort to characterise the folks engaged in their venal and morally questionable corporate shenanigans. Quite why Gillian Anderson is here is anyone’s guess, Jeff Bridges looks as if he ought to be off parting the Red Sea and the writing is largely irrelevant, save for a little psycho-babble towards an ending that reminded me a little of “Max” from Disney’s “Black Hole” (1979). There is the odd homage to bygone eras of video games, zeroes and ones but I found this a long old and disappointing two hours to sit through.",917,2025-10-15 15:54:50,2025-10-15 16:01:53

44,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Right from the outset, this doesn’t hang about as a near perfectly executed crypto robbery is carried out by a gang of young men in Macau. Despite mobilising the police and the several thousand cameras located across the city, the cops are short on clues so they draft in retired “Wong” (Jackie Chan) whose meticulous approach to his work soon leads them to suspect that the legendary “Shadow” is masterminding a group of ninja-esque men who are masters of disguise, martial arts and technology. He decides that the only way to track this man down is to recruit a squad of officers that don’t look remotely like they are investigating and then to embark on the mother of all door-to-door searches. Of course, and maybe a little implausibly, they manage to identify him (Tony Leung) - we know who it is right from the start - and a war of attrition ensues not just between the two men, but amongst their nemesis’s increasingly manoeuvred and conflicted “family” for whom trust and loyalty are soon severely tested. There is loads of action throughout, but it’s not the repetitious sort. More stylishly and tightly edited and choreographed with no windows, bones or furniture safe as the CGI and the action mix well before a denouement that offers us something of a twist and perhaps the scent of a revenge sequel down the line. The charismatic Chan brings a considered charm to his role, most of his antagonists are very agile and easy on the eye and Leung really does bring a little of the “Fu Manchu” to his character - powerful, menacing and always one step ahead. You might not be so certain about the safety of your bit-coin billions after watching this, though!",587,2025-10-11 16:56:58,2025-10-11 17:00:13
45,5,Review from MovieGuys,"""The Shadows Edge"" is yet another Hong Kong action thriller starring the actor named number one with movie fans in the region, Jackie Chan.

This film is good but its by no means great. Chan is a cop called back from retirement, when modern policing techniques conspicuously fail to catch, an ageing criminal, an expert in counter surveillance and his talented team of young cyber thieves.

Actions plentiful, with Chan's trademark, creative flair, using the environment and  everyday items, as devices for martial arts action. This is topped off with, at times, intense gun play and spectacular explosions. Taken together, these aspects, of this cinematic experience, represent an engaging romp.

The noticeable downside is this film is overly long. The result is the story, at times, becomes difficult to follow and the characterisations, can feel either drawn out or a bit overlooked.

In summary, a mostly decent action thriller with a, by now, well established, Hong Kong flavour. Would have benefited from a tighter script and shorter length. That said, still very much worth a look.",847,2025-11-27 20:57:51,2025-11-27 23:04:27

""Predator: Badlands is an audacious exercise in reinvention that takes a risk and triumphs. The movie excels in every technical department, featuring a spectacle of creature design and sound work, and offering a new thematic vision for the saga's longevity.

Elle Fanning's superb performance and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi's powerful physicality ensure Dek's journey — the creature who forgoes the Yautja code of honor in search of a deeper, collective capability — won't leave anyone indifferent. If there were still doubts that Dan Trachtenberg deserves the keys to the franchise, they've been dissipated once again.

It leaves us with the important message that even in the most lethal and solitary of cultures, cooperation and compassion can be the most powerful forms of survival.""

47,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"Predator: Badlands is the first Predator film since 2022’s Prey. It is also the second Predator-related media released this year. Hulu’s animated anthology film, Predator: Killer of Killers, is now streaming. All three titles were directed and/or written by Dan Trachtenberg.

Badlands follows Dek, a young Predator who yearns for his father's approval but struggles to escape the shadow of his bigger and older brother Kwei. Their father, viewing proud Yautja lineage as something reserved for only the strongest, sees Dek as weak and useless—wanting him dead to preserve the family’s honor. Dek’s perceived weakness, being the runt, drives both his father’s harsh stance and Dek’s desperate need to prove himself.

However, Kwei believes Dek deserves a chance to prove himself, hoping Dek can live up to his family's legacy. Predators choose their prey. Dek, eager to earn his father's respect and prove he’s not only a worthy warrior but also superior, selects Genna—a planet with a low survival rate. Dek chooses the Kalisk as his target, a predator believed to be unkillable, in an attempt to demonstrate his own fearlessness. When Dek’s father kills Kwei, Dek’s drive turns to vengeance, and, after surviving and escaping to Genna, he must now capture the Kalisk both to prove himself and to avenge his brother.

The Yautja are a proud and stubborn race that hunts alone. Dek tries to prove himself by surviving the perils of Genna. He reluctantly saves Thia (Elle Fanning), a damaged synthetic, hoping she can guide him. Thia says she's searching for her sister, Tessa, and knows where the Kalisk is, motivated by the desire for reunion. Dek brings her, unaware that he and the Weyland-Yutani Corporation pursue the same prey for their own ends.
Badlands is a lot of firsts for the Predator franchise. It’s the first time a Predator was named in any film. It is also the first time a Predator is a protagonist. The Yautja language was created by Britton Watkins, who was recommended by Paul Frommer, the creator of the Na’vi language for Avatar.

Dan Trachtenberg is eager to build a new Alien vs. Predator film or franchise, but wants to do it right. Predator: Badlands includes Easter eggs connecting those two cinematic universes and one more.
Badlands features pulse rifles from Aliens. The Weyland-Yutani logo on the back of Thia’s eyes resembles Andy’s eyes in Alien: Romulus. Dek’s armor and weapon preparation before the final battle is an homage to Amber Midthunder’s in Prey, which was already a nod to Dutch’s prep before the last battle in the original Predator. Tessa uses a power loader similar to the one Ripley uses to fight the Alien Queen in Aliens. A Harvester skull from Independence Day is visible on Kwei’s trophy wall.

Badlands runs a tight 107 minutes and is nearly nonstop action. Influences include Frank Frazetta, Terrence Malick, films like Shane (1953), The Road Warrior, Conan the Barbarian, The Book of Eli, Clint Eastwood westerns, Jaws, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and Star Wars; video games such as Shadow of the Colossus, Half-Life 2, Uncharted, God of War; and the comic book character Drax the Destroyer.
Genna is so deadly that Dek is surrounded by wildlife and otherworldly creatures out to kill him. 

Predator: Badlands channels Mad Max: Fury Road, letting non-stop action lead until the credits. Emphasis on the Yautja language (a universal translator allows characters to hear their native tongue), brutal action, and animals in the storyline give Badlands an ambiance similar to Genndy Tartakovsky’s animated epic, Primal.

Badlands has more visual effects shots than any other Predator film. The film credits several VFX studios, including Weta Workshop and ILM, for bringing this visual powerhouse to life. The film looks incredible, thanks in part to its breathtaking cinematography and nearly flawless visual effects. Each action sequence blends creativity, intense violence, and masterful CGI. Every battle is unforgettable, like when Dek cuts a bone bison in half in slow-motion with his plasma sword. The film skirts its PG-13 rating through violence, avoiding an R-rating since almost all onscreen blood is green from predators or white from synthetics.

The only flaw in Predator: Badlands is its straightforwardness and lack of depth. However, this film doesn't need complexity. It's easily one of the year's best action movies. Trachtenberg references past franchise films without simply repeating stories. You're invested in Dek, Thia, and Bud (a native creature bonded to Dek), and you notice almost every Easter egg. Yet, the story still feels fresh. Wherever Predator goes next, it promises a new journey for fans.

Savage, badass, and brutal, Predator: Badlands is the most action-packed Predator film yet. See this one in theaters for the best picture and sound—it’s worth every penny.",472,2025-11-11 16:44:49,2025-11-11 16:44:49
48,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"“Dek” is the runt of the “Yautja” clan so his militaristic father has asked his elder brother “Kwei” to get rid of him. Luckily, his brother isn’t so brutal and so with an impossible task on his hands to prove his worth, “Dek” manages to escape to a planet where he seeks to make a trophy from the menacing “Kalisk”. Thing is, this place is riddled with all sorts of flesh-eating monsters and plants so his own survival chances aren’t especially high until he encounters the top half of synthetic “Thia” (Elle Fanning) who is quite hot on keeping him alive and who agrees to work with him to achieve his task. It turns out, though, that she and her mission doppelgänger “Tessa” are on this world for a similar reason and him getting back home is not in their plans, let alone home with a creature that has impressive regenerative powers. What chance the young “Dek” can achieve his task, or perhaps even better - do something his tribe never do and learn to cooperate and maybe even make friends? Now it is fractionally better, but for the most part this really just reminded me of Adam Driver’s “65” (2023) as the whole premise of the “Predator” - the menacing and all-conquering alpha hunter - is abandoned in favour of this great looking but derivative story of survival with fangs against critters and plants that could have caused a stir in “Star Trek” in the 1960s. By flipping the established plot on it’s head like this, Dan Trachtenberg is almost asking us to sympathise for “Dek” rather than hide behind the sofa, and this manages to disappointingly humanise him - albeit monosyllabically - and reduce any sense of menace to a bare minimum. Sorry, but I was underwhelmed by the whole thing.",154,2025-11-20 11:54:55,2025-11-20 11:54:55

I think he brought the “aliens” in Cameron style to this pg13  Disney +  friendly film. So maybe for a  newer audience that wants to understand and identify with the originals. Movies now get “universe” in comic book format is how we lay film work. New normal. So get with the program, ya hard-to-please Treky Boomers. If you watch Badlands with all things considered, you find it delivers well. The originators of Alien and sci-fi alike also started woke back then. The real kind . It was green peace hippie and comic book loving pc building movie magic “woke” nowadays, so it’s not hard to see how the concepts and themes in the Badlands plot and story and character developments blended and balanced together with high energy ramping up music score. Cyberpunk space synth composed like an opera complemented the vibe in place far, far away ; ). Excellent delivery execution with precision made woke but like like a fine woke wine.",60,2025-12-02 08:30:35,2025-12-03 16:58:56

I'm convinced MAPPA got some blackmail stuff on their employees because HOW THE FUCK did they animate these scenes cuh.

Imagine you clapping them crazy cheeks and right wen u boutta buss she whispers in yo ear, **_“BOOM!""_**. I would die the fuck right there. 😭😭😭

Seriously tho, I did NOT expect this movie to have one of the best action sequences of the year.

I need whatever the hell these MAPPA animators are smoking, because HOW TF did they animate those scenes?

I didn't even care about Chainsaw Man a few days ago. But then I saw the great reviews for this movie so I decided to binge Season 1 to prepare for the movie. And now here I am thinking that this might be my favorite action movie of the year.

MAN, this movie was beautiful. And it's not just the action scenes that were good, but the story it's adapting (from the manga) is also soooooo good.

Don't even get me started on the music. ""In The Pool"" made me cry ngl. Even thinking about listening to that song is making me feel depressed and anxious.




Edit: WHY THE FUCK does that song sound so depressing, just thinking about listening to that song makes my chest start feeling heavy. This has never happened to me before. FUCK.

51,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Student “Denji” is already an accomplished demon hunter for the Japanese mob when they betray him and think him dead. Fortunately for him, his quick thinking and chainsaw wielding dog manages to morph together with his master thereby creating a critter with even more formidable devil slaying skills - and that is just as well because they are coming for him. Not, however, in the way he is expecting but via a much more subtle approach. That’s because the seemingly ditzy “Reze” enters his life, via a storm and a phone booth, and despite the fact that he has sworn to love “Makima”, he is soon entranced by her. Thing is, though, is she all that she seems? Now on a practical front, are chainsaws emanating from your arms and head really that useful a weapon when your opponent is as lithe and nimble as a ninja made from jelly? Well we are about to see as this action-packed animation hits the ground running and rarely pauses for breath as poor old “Denji” has to distinguish between friend and foe whilst his hormones do some independent raging of their own. It’s a stand-alone arc from the series so you don’t really miss out on much if you haven’t followed his adventures before, and there are all sorts of colourful mystical creatures for him to combat without the often used game-level look to these films. It has a defined and structured plot, with much more of a beginning and an end to it and though we don’t spend a load of time focussing on the characters (or their development!!) this is still one of the liveliest “love” stories you’ll likely ever have seen. It also benefits from being quite short, and so it can sustain the adventure elements better as the pace starts off fairly frenetically and doesn’t slow up. There’s a sort of slushy phase at the start, but don’t worry it doesn’t last as this vividly animated slasher makes idle work for the devil’s hands.",610,2025-11-07 10:59:43,2025-11-07 11:03:22
52,30,Review from The Movie Mob,"**Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor’s footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.**

It’s a James Cameron film, so it’s impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na’vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na’vi learns to be ocean Na’vi and then fight Stephen Lang. But the new movie also focuses on a group of annoying teens that constantly get themselves in trouble and peril over and over again throughout the much too long 3+ hour runtime and sidelining better, more established characters. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original at every turn. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that’s all it is.",262,2022-12-16 06:48:15,2022-12-16 14:07:45
53,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-spoiler-free-review

""Avatar: The Way of Water clearly sets itself apart from other blockbusters, building on 13 years of preparation to deliver a memorable CINEMA experience by the one and only James Cameron.

A visually, technically breathtaking adventure, particularly in the truly stunning underwater sequences. Score (Simon Franglen) remains epic, and the genuine dynamics between the characters of the Sully family lead the viewer to strongly, emotionally invest in them - the performances of the cast, namely Zoe Saldaña, are vital for the film's success.

Too bad the recycled, generic narrative doesn't keep up with the creativity, dedication, and innovation levels allocated to the technical elements. Underwhelming to the point of making the three-hour runtime feel heavier than it should, but for fans of the original - which remains supreme - it's far from ruining one of the year's must-see theater experiences.""

54,31,Review from tmdb45226627,"An exciting return to Pandora: the world of Na&#39;vi. One of the best movies, like 2009&#39;s Avatar, to see in 3D! The characters seem to come out of the screen and it seems to witness the events firsthand. The world of Na&#39;vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist&#39;s love and life story.",325,2022-12-17 21:59:01,2022-12-19 15:43:37
55,32,Review from TimeZone,"**My rating: 10/10**
Why? I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.

**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.

The story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).

**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.
Spidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can’t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin’ Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. 

**3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don’t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.

**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don’t need to say more.",724,2022-12-19 06:28:23,2022-12-19 15:42:48
56,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"State-of-the-art special effects, revolutionary underwater cameras, and the resurrection of what is otherwise a mostly forgotten movie theater format can’t hide the fact that _Avatar: The Way of Water_ is basically the same movie as the original with more blue people (some are slightly green now!) that get on your last nerve. The emotion in the film feels forced and the story is like swapping a blue thread for a green one as it threads the same, withered fabric from 2009. This is a special effects extravaganza with nauseating results that only partially impresses and mostly succumbs to being its own biggest fanatic.

58,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Well we ought not to have expected ""Jake"" (Sam Worthington) and ""Neytiri"" (Zoe Saldana) to have let the grass grow during the intervening years since we were first introduced to the idyllic world of ""Pandora"". Now with four children and their human friend ""Spider"" (Jack Champion - remember Johnny Sheffield?), they are living life to the full. Until, that is, one night they see a new star in the sky. Star? Well, no - it's the ships announcing the return of the human beings, this time even more bent on the conquest of their planet now that the Earth is finally on it's knees. Armed to the hilt with the latest technology and weaponry, and commanded by the essence of the departed ""Col. Quaritch"" - who also now leads a squad of Na'vi-esque avatars of his own - things look ominous for the ""Sully"" family. Realising that they are front and centre for their persecutors, they relocate to (saddle themselves on) a remote, water-based community where they hope, rather unrealistically, to be able to sit it out... This is undoubtedly a beautiful piece of cinema to watch. 3D and IMAX with a classily crafted score from Simon Franglen and a message that trumpets the cruciality of the symbiotic relationships between all creatures that live on a world where co-operation and understanding are vital to the survival of all. Thing is, though, that all of that glorious cinematography starts to get just a bit repetitive after about an hour and the middle portion of this really does drag. Indeed, were this to have been a long ""Blue Planet"" style documentary alerting us to the dangers of mankind's rampant abuse of resources with scant regard to the implications for any other species, then I would have enjoyed it better in three parts with Sir David Attenborough's mellifluous narration. It isn't though, and the story is stretched so terribly thinly that - sorry, sacrilege I know - I was actually bored a bit. It does pick up for the last forty minutes or so as the denouement provides for loads of action-packed pyrotechnics but to be honest, I had sort of lost interest by that point. Certainly, it is a great looking film that offers us food for thought, but as a story - I thought it weak, predictable and at times it does just a little too much of it's own recycling. Indeed - had their children actually done what they were told in the first place, there might not have been much of a story at all! Essential on a big screen.",122,2022-12-24 04:46:47,2023-01-04 16:01:19

60,35,Review from Nathan,"Avatar: The Way of Water is a visual spectacle from start to finish. The scenery, cinematography, and CGI constantly had a smile on my face, but is it enough to carry the film?

While the previous entry had its fair share of story-related problems, the sequel corrects most of my issues and delivers a heartfelt family story. The main improvement from the first entry is character development. I had a genuine emotional connection with the Sully family and was invested in their safety. These feelings created some genuine tension when any of the family members were in danger, I felt my body tense up as I waited to see what the conflict's conclusion would be, which is a gigantic improvement from the first film where I could not care less who died or survived.

The return of Stephan Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch brought the overly campy villain back to the screen in a bad way. Quaritch is a caricature of a ""villain"" where his actions and attitude are evil for the sake of being the bad guy. His anger toward Jake Sully does seem a little bit more believable hear as his previous self was murdered by him, but the over-the-top theatrics are just too much for me.

Another aspect of the story that did not feel right to me was the children constantly disobeying their parents for the sake of plot progression. Countless times, Jake Sully's kids would do the opposite of what they were told, leaving them in a vulnerable state to be captured. This danger forced Jake Sully to constantly expose himself and help draw the threat ever closer to his family. The moments that result are great as we get to see the dichotomy between Jake being a father and his militaristic background. This is at the heart of the story and worked for me.

I was surprised to see how well-paced the film was despite its over three-hour runtime. There are some pretty slow parts, specifically the second act, but the visuals and the character journeys that happen during these parts are so interesting that they didn't impact me negatively; I was just happy to see new and beautiful aspects of Pandora.

The performances were fantastic throughout. It is a testament to both the actors/actresses and also the technology that can display such complex emotions and visual nuances on entirely CGI creatures. Sigourney Weaver was a highlight with Kiri, who was at the forefront of the entire film. To be completely honest, I did not even know she was played by Weaver; the mix between her performance and voice modulation created a compelling 14-year-old girl that was a huge part of the story. Sam Worthington was incredible and Zoe Saldana was perfect. Saldana does so much acting with her facial expressions as Ney'tirl, which is on display during many emotional scenes her character goes through. She was a bit sidelined during this film, but when she was on screen, she was impactful.

Avatar has some incredibly heavy themes at play. One of the strongest and most relevant messages was anti-poaching. I mention this because there was such a hard scene in this movie that had me on the verge of tears. It was something I'd never seen in the film; it was both beautiful in the brutality it displayed and the emotional response of the Na'vi.

Overall, this movie is deserving of the hype and needs to be seen on the biggest screen available. James Cameron delivered on the 13 years build-up to the sequel and has gotten me excited for the three sequels planned for the next decade.

62,37,Review from John Chard,"It's cinema Jim, but not as we know it. 

So here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.

No doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.

The cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen ""The Party Crasher"" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron's Behemoth. 5/10",655,2020-04-25 14:27:48,2024-05-16 15:22:27

66,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"This is another of these films for which I didn't get the memo. It undoubtedly has parallels with the ecological ravaging of Earth by mankind, but for the most part it is just a fairly standard action romance that owes much of it's significance to it being an outstanding technical production. Sam Worthington is ""Jake"", a paraplegic solider who is tasked with assisting on a mission on a distant planet. By way of a bribe, the authorities offer him surgery to restore his mobility if he uses an avatar machine to infiltrate the folks inhabiting the planet ""Pandora"". The more he explores this bright new world, the more he begins to integrate with the people and their beautiful and colourful environment. His affection for ""Neytiri"" (Zoe Saldana) and his gradually developing appreciation of just what his mission is about, sets him up for a serious conflict with the gung-ho militaristic ""Quaritch"" (Stephen Lang). This film is all about corporate greed and an horrendous disregard not just for nature, but for an indigenous population that is though frequently touching, let down by a really mediocre cast, some slightly pontificating dialogue and yes, it is really too long. It is great to look at, the standards of the production mixing reality with animation are outstanding; it's just that the story is just all a bit lightweight.",83,2024-06-01 19:41:01,2024-06-01 19:41:01

Rating: C+

""Troll 2 is a sequel that, while competent and occasionally entertaining, struggles to find its own identity in the shadow of its predecessor.

It's a perfect example that sometimes more monsters and more destruction don't equate to a better story, and that movie magic often lies in what isn't seen rather than what's computer-generated to fill the screen.

The action scenes are indeed grandiose, and there's a deeper dive into Nordic mythology, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the rustic and palpable soul of this saga was polished until it lost its original shine, transforming an ancient legend into mere quick-consumption content.""",961,2025-12-01 08:51:50,2025-12-01 08:51:50
68,5,Review from MovieGuys,"""Trolls 2"" feels somewhat like a remake of the original. There's little that's all that new on offer here. It builds in a very modest way, on the tale of Nordic trolls, from the first film. It introduces a few new ideas and twists but it fails to do anything truly original that would have made it a genuine successor to the first film. 

Action is well done but the finale feels like its comes and goes, all to quickly.

In summary, no harm in making a sequel but you do need to ensure it offers something more than what went before. Regrettably, Trolls 2 fails to build on the solid formula established in the first film. A mediocre watch.

Intrigued, they ask one of their guides to regale them all with a story of elemental proportions that takes them back centuries to the very emergence of local deities in the ancient Bangra kingdom. There were two tribes who coexisted, peaceably enough, sharing the fruits of their idyllic wilderness until one strayed onto the territory of the other with tragic results. This led to a reciprocal action that soon had all the hallmarks of a conflict that will involve trading in not just the spices and coffee, but in further facilitating the Portuguese-operated slave trade supported by the violent and cowardly king “Kulshekar” (Gulshan Devalah). Despotically, he seizes on an opportunity to invade the jungle garden to destroy their village and enslave the people after their leader “Berme” (Rishab Shetty) takes control of their port and so sets up a battle of epic proportions between not just these two men, but of the powerful daiva who are now empowering both sides with some super-human powers. Given the richness of the mythology and the colourful vigour of the production, this is quite a thrilling story that showcases Shetty as a charismatic action hero with an heart of gold whilst also allowing Devalah to have some fun as the brooding megalomaniac too. Aside from a little politically charged romance with princess “Kanakavathi” (Rukmini Vasanth) it’s all grand scale, end to end, stuff that effortlessly mixes the fantastic and the mythological with loads of pyrotechnics and combat scenarios that intertwine the plentiful CGI into the action scenes to create quite a compelling and entertaining adventure movie. Yes, there are a few songs - and I don’t love those, but it’s almost three hours flew by and I enjoyed it.",180,2025-10-09 18:13:53,2025-10-09 18:13:54
73,42,Review from Jenny,"🌟 10/10 – A Visual Masterpiece That Redefines Anime Cinema 🌟

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Infinity Castle is not just anime—it's an art form in motion. Ufotable has once again shattered expectations, delivering what is arguably the greatest animation ever seen in anime history. Every frame of Infinity Castle is a painting. Every battle is a symphony of light, color, movement, and emotion.

The sheer scale of the Infinity Castle arc is staggering. Shifting gravity, kaleidoscopic architecture, and relentless pacing pull you into a world that feels boundless and terrifying. And through this madness, the animators create visual clarity and storytelling precision that defy logic. The fights aren’t just flashy—they’re intimate, brutal, and deeply emotional. You feel every breath, every strike, every sacrifice.

Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and the Hashira face impossible odds with a sense of weight and urgency that grips your chest. Character moments hit harder than ever. The Upper Moons are terrifying in both presence and power. And Muzan? An absolute force of dread.

What truly sets Infinity Castle apart isn’t just the spectacle—though it is unparalleled. It’s the way the animation serves the heart of the story. Loyalty, grief, fury, and love are painted across the screen with every cut, every cry, every flicker of a blade.

This is peak anime. A cultural milestone. A visual symphony.
Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle is what happens when anime dares to be legendary.

🔥 A flawless 10/10. Nothing comes close. 🔥",281,2025-08-03 19:10:54,2025-08-29 21:56:18
74,43,Review from dumasori,"Good but not extraordinary 

I watched it yesterday, and movies like this deserve no less than an IMAX experience.

Having said that, I walked out with a mixed experience. I felt that they tried to squeeze too many side stories in one movie. In the first 2/3 of the movie, you keep going back and forth from fight scenes to side stories, which breaks the tempo. It was not well executed, and I would have preferred if they just finished one side story and then come back to the fight scenes to finish it. Also, many side stories were finished in rush, which did not add much context of emotions.

Overall, the actions sequences and sound effects were great. I think they have 2 more movies linked up to finale, and hope they conclude the story in a more meaningful way.",510,2025-09-12 03:29:38,2025-09-12 03:29:38
75,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"This latest series of adventures sees “Tanjiro” and “Nezuko” drawn into the equivalent of an animated Escher drawing as both they and the Hashira have to face a formidable array of Upper Rank demons as they sink lower and lower into this perfectly detailed, fluid, abyss of a construction. With the ultimate battle against “Muzan” getting ever closer, they must first face the mighty “Akaza” who has not only a remarkable arsenal of quirks and skills, but also something hitherto unseen by our intrepid “Tanjiro” - bit how to defeat it? It’s a film that starts as we are used to, with end to end combat scenes but around the midway point, we flip the vinyl over and enter onto an altogether more informative path. We are being told of the tragedies that touched the life of “Akaza” before his demonic days. We learn of a time when he was capable of love and affection, but was in turn subject to the most heinous of betrayals that left his soul vulnerable to the temptations of a life where revenge on those who offended him (think “Anakin Skywalker” a little bit) when offered to him. It is good to see little more in-depth characterisation going on in this film, it helps us to balance the forces of good and evil and there is more than plenty action to keep the pace moving and avoid that backstory becoming too melancholic. The setting within the aptly named “Infinity Castle” challenges linear perspectives effectively with an effective sense of the multi-dimensional that allows the artists (and the CGI) to assume something gossamer-like as solid structures melt and what is down becomes up and gravity takes a back seat. It has some gore to it, and some scenes aren’t for the faint-hearted, but it’s the best yet of the “Demon Slayer” movies and stands alone, well.",707,2025-09-19 14:33:39,2025-09-19 14:38:06
76,44,Review from Nick,"Infinity Castle is a breathtaking kickoff to the final Demon Slayer saga, and it wastes no time plunging us into the chaos. The animation is jaw-dropping, with Ufotable pushing their craft to dizzying new heights—fluid battles, haunting visuals, and a sense of scale that makes every frame feel monumental. The pacing is relentless but never empty, balancing spectacle with raw emotion as Tanjiro and the Hashira face their darkest trials yet. While it’s clearly setting the stage for an epic trilogy (with 2027 and 2029 still looming), this first entry stands tall on its own—delivering both tragedy and triumph in equal measure. It ends not with closure, but with anticipation, leaving you desperate for what comes next. A near-perfect blend of heart and spectacle.",333,2025-09-21 05:19:51,2025-10-08 22:39:01
77,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"George Clooney starred, co-wrote and directed this interesting wartime drama. It centres around an elite squad sent to try to rescue precious works of art from the retreating Nazi war machine. Not elite in an SAS or SEAL type military sense, but dedicated to identifying and preserving these artefacts that could be anything from a small painting to a life-sized statue. Historically and logistically it is all over the place, but it has a feel-good sentiment to it for the most part. It focusses on another quite visceral, but perhaps less often considered aspect of the atrocities to posterity carried out during WWII. Matt Damon (""Granger"") features occasionally as he tries to convince ""Claire Simone"" (Cate Blanchett) in Paris that they are not just going to loot the art for their own museums and there is enough action involved to illustrate just how dangerous the end of the war was as they race to prevent the destruction. The production is adequate, nothing more to be fair, but this film is enjoyable to watch with a message that endures long after the mediocre performances from the talent have diminished. Perhaps some objectivity behind the camera might have helped - Clooney is too close to what is clearly a labour of love for him, but it's still worth a watch.",11,2022-04-15 08:14:49,2022-04-15 08:14:49
78,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Vin Diesel is actually quite good in this as an adventurer who manages, frequently, to wind up US law enforcement by causing mischief and mayhem against those he thinks deserving of exposure. When NSA agent ""Gibbons"" (Samuel L. Jackson) arranges for him and his team to be dumped in the Czech Republic they have a choice - infiltrate a ruthless gang of Russian hoodlums bent on world domination or... go to jail. Initially, the team think it's all an hoax but as it becomes clear that they actually are in a real scenario it all starts to heat up. Diesel has bags of charisma, attitude and muscle on screen, for this. Sure, it's not new nor will the writing and dialogue cause you to need a dictionary (unless you are about seven years old) but as action films go, it is perfectly watchable with plenty of car chases, pyrotechnics and gadgets",129,2023-09-03 07:00:37,2023-09-03 07:00:37
79,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"This is quite an entertaining stand alone fantasy adventure that doesn’t really require you to know anything about what’s gone on before. Thanks to the sacred lotus, there’s a bit of reincarnation going on, but will that be completed in time to save the population of the “Chentang Pass” about to be attacked by an army of lava-borne devils? With certain defeat looming, the immortals start to take an hand in things - not unlike the story of the siege of Troy, and just like that take from antiquity, there is plenty of betrayal and duplicity to complement the more traditional stories of loyalty, family and team building as the story gradually builds to it’s pot-boiling climax. The CGI is better than many, much less two-dimensional, and there is lots of vibrant action as the naive but honourable young “Nezha” must find his own destiny, define his relationship with the more clean cut “Ao Bing” all despite the distant intervention of the “Loong” dragon kings and always under the watchful gaze of the cloud-hopping “Wu Liang” - a being outwardly benign and munificent, but is he all that he seems behind that grey beard? If you are of a mind to look deeper, then it may well offer up a critique of modern China - or, quite possibly many other societies, where the weak are manipulated and persecuted, where family is increasingly undervalued and where power and riches are the true gods. Essentially, I just found it to be a classily produced computer animation that mixed the astonishing richness of Chinese mythology with a solid adventure concept and just a little bit of pantomime humour as we go along. It looks great in a cinema, and doesn’t hang about getting off to a lively start  and pacing well for a couple of action-packed hours.",55,2025-03-17 07:47:45,2025-03-17 07:51:36
80,45,Review from wu66chen,"**“Ne Zha 2” – A Spectacle with Hidden Flaws**

Ne Zha 2 is undeniably one of the most talked-about Chinese animated films this year. It shines in visual spectacle and box office performance, yet its storytelling, character development, and marketing approach have raised considerable controversy.

**Strengths: A Blend of Technical Brilliance and Emotional Pull**

To begin with, the film’s visuals are stunning. From the vast underwater world to intense battle sequences, the technical craftsmanship sets a new benchmark for Chinese animation. The art direction, with its distinct Eastern fantasy flavor, delivers imagery that rivals Hollywood productions.

On an emotional level, the bond between Ne Zha and Ao Bing still resonates. Themes of friendship and family, though somewhat conventional, are presented with enough intensity to move audiences. For fans of the first film, this familiar emotional thread is a key factor in sustaining box office momentum.

**Weaknesses: Shallow Story, Stagnant Characters**

But when we shift our focus from spectacle to story, the shortcomings become apparent.

Contrived storytelling: Many conflicts feel forced, driven by the need to move the plot rather than by genuine character motivation. Supporting roles such as Shen Gongbao or Lady Stone are reduced to narrative props.

Repetitive character arcs: Ne Zha’s rebellious transformation was already central in the first film, yet this sequel repeats the same beats without offering meaningful growth.

Uneven pacing: The film relies heavily on set pieces while skimming over emotional build-up. Comedy and tragedy often feel abrupt, creating the impression that technical “show-off” takes precedence over genuine storytelling.

As a result, despite its dazzling surface, the film often feels hollow, lacking the lasting depth that keeps stories alive in memory.

**Marketing and Box Office Tactics: Overexertion**

After release, the film’s run was extended four times, stretching from the Lunar New Year season all the way into summer. While promoted as a response to “audience demand,” it was largely a deliberate strategy to inflate box office numbers. This prolonged dominance squeezed out newer films and led to audience fatigue.

Even more curious was the phenomenon of fans buying multiple tickets to give away to friends or colleagues—essentially acting as street promoters for the studio. While this boosted revenue figures, it also undermines the authenticity of box office as a measure of genuine audience interest. Numbers driven by hype are not the same as numbers driven by real demand.

**Conclusion: Industrial Triumph, Narrative Regret**

Ne Zha 2 stands as an impressive industrial achievement, showcasing China’s growth in animation technology, marketing, and commercial execution. Yet its reliance on spectacle and aggressive box office tactics highlights a core issue: without strong storytelling and deeper character work, such success risks feeling hollow.

The film is both a milestone and a mirror—it reflects the heights Chinese animation can reach, while reminding us that lasting impact still depends not on hype or spectacle, but on the strength of the story itself.",864,2025-09-03 11:32:23,2025-09-12 16:13:49
81,46,Review from tmdb90329212,"Bro, Nezha 2 completely misses the point of the first movie. In the first one, the dragons weren’t enemies they were tricked by The Supreme Lords into doing their dirty work, capturing monsters, and ended up also being trapped in the underwater purgatory. But in the second movie, the story feels totally disconnected from that and somehow leaving doesn't matter nor some of the problems caused. Like It honestly seems like the producers didn’t even try, since some scenes look copied and pasted from the original and the movie in general don't make sense in many parts nor what the actual

It's not phenomenal or so, but definitely not a lot to complain about. It is a testosterone trip to an extent, but I'm not complaining. Those who are complaining are not really the target audience, it seems.

Towards the end, there are some risky bets and plot armour, but it's a film, not a documentary. It could have benefited from a somewhat better runtime. 3.5 hrs is long. It dials up the violence meter for mainstream Bollywood, but nothing too shocking and not too much of it either.

Ranveer is actually more vulnerable, more grounded, except when he's not. Then he's just Tommy Vercetty. Given that Aditya is just 42, I do see early GTA could be part of his college years.",453,2025-12-11 10:02:34,2025-12-11 15:22:49
83,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ fandomwire.com/frankenstein-review/

""Frankenstein is a powerful, visceral film that solidifies Guillermo del Toro as a master of atmosphere and emotion.

Thanks to Jacob Elordi's transcendent performance as The Creature and exceptional multi-departmental work, the movie takes the legendary tale and transforms it into a deep, complex meditation on human fallibility and the terror of rejection. It's a visual and thematic experience that demands patience and personal, intellectual, and emotional investment.

Shockingly violent, it's undeniably one of the most important stories of the year. The combination of geniuses in front of and behind the camera results in a feature that confronts us with an undeniable truth: the tale of Frankenstein isn't about creating a monster; it's about the eternal and necessary challenge of recognizing our own humanity in those we reject.""

84,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"This has got be Oscar Isaac at his best yet, depicting the obsessive scientist hell-bent on proving that he could use science to defeat death itself. He is the son of an acclaimed but rather brutal physician (Charles Dance) and is galvanised further to his chosen path by the sudden death of his mother. His theories disgust civilised society but the wealthy “Harlander” (Christophe Waltz) agrees to fund his experiments to what he hopes will be their logical conclusion. Now secreted away in his remote castle, and quite literally cannibalising spare parts from graveyards and mortuaries alike, he awaits that lightning storm that could just bring Jacob Elordi to life. The problem for the Baron is that he is disappointed with his creation and has no concept that it looks to him very much as a father. Imprisoned in the basement, the “monster” is befriended by “Elizabeth” (Mia Goth) who sympathises with it’s ghastly predicament - but before she can help a great conflagration sets in train a cat and mouse struggle between created and creator that takes them to the depths of the frozen wastes where an exploration ship is trapped in thick pack ice - where our story both starts and concludes. Isaac really does own his megalomaniac obsessive role here and the whole creative effort put into the production design turns this from simple science fiction into a multi-textured love story with it’s fair share of moral dilemmas, hate and loathing too. Elordi? Well he does bring back memories of Christopher Lee in this role, only here is is also rewarded with an extra degree of articulation and towards the end, more of a conscience and even an amount of personality - and he manages to portray his character’s frustrated and confused conflict well, if fairly sparingly. Whilst there are common points of reference with earlier iterations of this story, this enlivens it in a far more characterful and in many ways more justifiable way, and I thought it flew by. Big screen if you can, though Netflix does seem to have limited it’s cinema release quite a bit, because it might lose much of it’s stylish and gothic menace as well as it’s emotionally-charged nuance on a small screen.",269,2025-11-07 16:10:43,2025-11-07 16:13:29

As with any GDT film, it is exceedingly interesting visually, and I'd go so far as to say his visual language rivals Tim Burton in excellence. This film is a visual marvel in basically every scene, a veritable feast for the eyes.

There are some great performances, especially among the bit players: Charles Dance, Christoph Waltz, and David Bradley in particular.

The visuals are exceedingly spectacular and colorful, and the dark hues filled with a beautiful gothic macabre to each piece, making a whole. 
A new perspective comes to light, one of Loneliness, Trauma, and of Yearning to part of this life as we call it. Life lessons are being learned and lived, even if only too briefly, and then once again, the inevitable search through the loneliness continues.

90,50,Review from Bri,"_“An idea, a feeling became clear to me. The hunter did not hate the wolf. The wolf did not hate the sheep. But violence felt inevitable between them. Perhaps, I thought this was the way of the world. It would hunt you and kill you just for being who you are.” _

_**Frankenstein** (2025)_ is truly a gem. This reminded me a lot of the original and the connection between what is human and what is monstrous was reflected well in the script. The cinematography and editing fit this story perfectly. 

Why is it always women who humanize what others perceive as dangerous? Mia Goth portrayed Elizabeth beautifully and she fits the gothic genre to a T. I love how they showed the way each character interacted with him and how one humanized him (pronouns: he) and the other dehumanized him (pronouns: it). 

Some things were a little too on the nose. But Im letting it slide for the pure enjoyment and emotion the film provoked in me. If you’re going to ask if I cried, act like you know me. You know I did. 

Of course, I always praise Oscar Issac for any and everything he’s in. He brings characters to life so well I’d watch a film of him watching paint dry. I didn’t know Jacob Eldori was in this until the credits and bravo to him for being a convincing son of Frankenstein. Would definitely watch this again!",501,2025-11-26 02:27:23,2025-11-30 17:53:42
91,5,Review from MovieGuys,"""Frankenstein"", Mary Shelly's epic work, is, at its heart, a cautionary tale, of man's scientific hubris, defying both God and nature.
  
Lets start by saying this film is, in most respects a more than decent. Acting is, for the  most part, outstanding, as are the creature effects. What can be honestly said, however, is this film bears only a remote resemblance, to Shelly's novel. 

The core of this story, as I see it, is a dysfunctional father son relationship. Victor Frankenstein's own failed relationship, with his father, is mirrored in his callous and at times, cruel, treatment of his surrogate son, the creature, he conjures into existence.

Is that a bad thing? I guess it depends on your point of view. As an ardent Shelly fan, (I was actually in the process of re-reading Frankenstein, when this was released) it felt a little lacking. 

The relationship between the creature and Frankenstein, is markedly less complex, than that portrayed in the novel. The creature in the book, is a tragic, ultimately sympathetic figure but also capable of considerable guile and cruelty. These aspects of its personality, are downplayed, in this tale. Victor Frankenstein is, for his part, more someone who has showen an horrific, irrevocable, error in judgement and is now trapped, as opposed to being overtly cruel and callous.  

In summary, ""Frankenstein"" bears only a passing semblance to Shelly's remarkable work. This is a decent film, of that there can be no doubt but it needs to viewed in isolation from the novel. The underlying message is something of a departure. Certainly its not as sophisticated, in terms of the relationship it establishes between Frankenstein and his creation. Nonetheless, worth a look.",473,2025-12-03 02:46:53,2025-12-11 21:44:51

Where it falls down somewhat is its rather abrupt final scenes. There's no real build up, things just happen, leaving it feeling somewhat perfunctory.

Stuck on their own, though, what chance either man or mutt can survive what appears to be something distinctly evil lingering around them? It has it’s moments, but moments are all they are as this really thin story quite literally pads along, slowly, without very much happening.

98,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"It has long been speculated (and widely believed) that animals possess special powers to sense things that we, as humans, generally cannot. This is particularly true of canines, and that belief is thought to contribute significantly to the loyal and protective bond that exists between us and dogs, the basis of their so-called designation as “man’s best friend.” That notion is now brought to life in writer-director Ben Leonberg’s debut feature, a smart horror offering that will melt your heart while giving viewers more than a few good scares along the way. When lovable pup Indy and his owner, Todd (Shane Jensen), move to a rural home, the insightful pooch quickly discovers that he and his master live in a haunted house, one that’s overrun by supernatural forces. Indy is quick to catch on that’s something’s amiss, thanks to his glimpses of spectral visions while awake and in his dreams. He does his level-best to warn Todd, but the language barrier obviously makes this difficult. Consequently, Indy attempts to protect his master despite ever-growing threats to their safety and well-being, as well as Todd’s mysteriously steadily worsening health. In some respects, “Good Boy” may seem like it’s rooted in a classic horror flick narrative, but I classify it as a smart horror offering thanks to its efforts to do something more with the story, in this case, a new spin, told from a different perspective, than what one typically finds in films from its root genre. The filmmaker also keeps the material fresh by using a variety of camera angles, featuring truly distinctive cinematography and editing techniques, efforts that helped the picture earn a well-deserved Independent Spirit Award nomination for best film editing, a rarity for movies of this type. The director also knew enough to keep this release from overstaying its welcome, coming in at an economical 1:13:00 runtime, long enough to successfully hold audience interest without belaboring its material or resorting to the inclusion of needless padding to stretch out the length. And, of course, there’s the star of the show, Indy, the positively adorable heroic four-legged protagonist who comes across like Lassie with a more personable, more lovable personality. Indy’s “performance” is truly impressive, too (even if it took the filmmaker four years to capture enough suitable footage to make the picture work, but kudos for his patience in working with a canine actor). As I’ve made clear on numerous previous occasions, I’m not an especially huge fan of horror movies, either because they’re boring, unoriginal and/or needlessly gratuitous. However, I’m becoming a true devotee of smart horror offerings like this, pictures that make a concerted effort to overcome those aforementioned shortcomings and give viewers watches that are genuinely more substantive and worthwhile. And what better way to accomplish that goal than by including a cute little tail-wagger? A movie like that is almost certain to get my vote, as this one most certainly does.",100,2025-12-07 13:53:31,2025-12-07 13:53:31
99,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"GOOD BOY is a testament to the unshakable, pure loyalty that defines the relationship with our most faithful friends.

I've always held a special place in my heart for films that explore the unique bond between humans and their pets, so the premise of a horror movie seen through a dog's eyes immediately piqued my curiosity. There's something inherently terrifying about watching a dog stare into an empty corner of a room, and director Ben Leonberg captures that dread perfectly through expert use of shadows, light, and negative space. It's a remarkably well-shot indie flick that avoids cheap jump scares in favor of a slow-burn, atmospheric build-up. Indy, the canine lead, is absolutely the soul of the experience; he's a ""good boy"" in every sense, delivering an incredibly expressive performance through his posture and those enchanting eyes. I can only imagine the patience and skill required to center a production around a dog, and the lack of CGI or fake animals makes the entire ordeal feel grounded and sensorial.

GOOD BOY eventually begins to lose its initial momentum, as the repetitive nature of the scenes and a relatively thin narrative start to show. The story surrounding the house's supernatural elements feels underdeveloped, and the deep ambiguity doesn't always mesh well with the more traditional haunted house tropes. There's a persistent feeling that this might have functioned better as a tight short film, as the lack of dialogue and some rather distracting ADR work prevent it from reaching a more compelling level of character depth. Despite these shortcomings, I'm still impressed by the movie's commitment to simplicity and its lean runtime. At its core, this is a story about the silent, protective nature of our animal companions that any dog lover will find deeply moving.

""One Battle After Another is a technical feat, a movie with brilliant performances and a thematic density that can only be truly processed after multiple viewings over time.

It's a chaotic, intense, and surprisingly hilarious examination of the state of America, the weight of history, and how the fight for a better future is passed from one generation to the next. The entire cast is phenomenal, but newcomer Chase Infiniti is a true revelation, delivering a captivating and emotionally powerful performance that perfectly embodies the theme of generational hope.

While I don't share the hyperbole generated by the initial reactions, it's clearly one of the most important and well-made films of the year. Driven by a masterful score and a sharp script from Paul Thomas Anderson, where every detail matters, it's a dense story about the battles we cannot escape and the family we fight for.

102,52,Review from gvasil,"The undisputed film of the year has only been in theaters for 4 days, yet it has already captivated audiences and critics alike, and not without reason. Amidst hundreds of mediocrities released every year, a film finally emerges that emphatically has something to say. And indeed, at the most suitable social and historical moment.

The film narrates the lives of people who chose to take action against the man-eating capitalist system of the 21st century, which inevitably degenerates into a fascist regime when reactions grow. And primarily, it focuses on the consequences these individuals face from the vengeful state apparatus, which sweeps away anything and anyone who dares to oppose it.

The film was released in theaters on September 26, 2025, before the first year of Donald Trump's second presidential term was even completed, and more than 3 years before the next presidential elections. Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA), writing and directing One Battle After Another, takes a clear political stance on what is happening in the United States and globally. The film may take place in the US, but it does not focus on specific individuals, not even as institutions, and thus could refer to any country where democracy is ailing.

The mastery of direction and the musical score is such that time flows relativistically quickly for the viewer, making the nearly 3-hour duration evaporate before you realize you’ve entered the theater. From a directorial perspective, new pages of cinematic history have been written, culminating in the car chase on the hilly Texas Dip highway of Borrego Springs. The performances of the exceptional cast are all very good, without any one standing out as Oscar-worthy. Sean Penn once again showcases his talent in the role of the villain, possessing the unique gift of becoming truly unlikable to the viewer in such roles (see Carlito’s Way, etc.).

However, the essence and power of the film is undoubtedly its political message. Through the vehicle of fiction, Paul Thomas Anderson releases his political manifesto, which leaves no room for misinterpretation. From the title of the film to the shot of DiCaprio watching the film ""The Battle of Algiers"" by Gillo Pontecorvo, the message is clear. When democracy and individual freedoms are under attack, citizens must take action. In contrast, however, to ""The Battle of Algiers,"" where we observe, in part, historical events that took place during Algeria's liberation struggle against French imperialism, in Anderson's film we become spectators of events that have not yet occurred, at least not in the United States. Yes, protests, and indeed massive ones, have taken place and are happening more frequently lately. But the film One Battle After Another does not propose sit-ins and placards as a solution. On the contrary, it primarily serves as a manual on the ""how:. The ""when"", is still unknown. One thing is certain. American society is boiling. And some are preparing. On both sides.",47,2025-09-30 09:02:45,2025-10-08 22:28:12
103,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"A group of would-be revolutionaries in the USA storm an immigration centre and whilst they manage to free many of it’s captives, their leader “Perfidia” (Teyana Taylor) manages to make quite an impression on it’s commander “Lockjaw” (Sean Penn). Sadly for her though, she doesn’t remain free for very long afterwards but in that meantime she and fellow rebel “Bob” (Leonardo DiCaprio) have managed to have a baby. Spool on and now she is a teenager living quietly with her dad, entirely unaware of her dangerous provenance. “Lockjaw” has no intention of forgetting the slight paid to him, and when he cottons on to their location he sends in his heavies. She is apprehended, he escapes, and the rest of this follows his adventures as he tries to mobilise his old friends and rescue his daughter “Willa” (Chase Infiniti). Now this looks great, the pace is pretty break-neck and the dialogue is quick-fire and frequently quite pithy as we merge a series of scenarios that reminded me of the “A-Team”. DiCaprio looks like he is enjoying himself, as does Penn, but both of their characters and the underlying conspiratorial plot are disappointingly undercooked as the adventure builds and to it’s high octane conclusion. Does it really need to be so long? I’m not so sure. It does come across as a little disjointedly episodic at times but it is also politically bang-on (depending on your perspective) as it capitalises on currently salient points around immigration, corporatisation and militarisation. I didn’t love it and I do think it has been over-hyped, but it’s still a solidly entertaining watch.",683,2025-10-10 14:22:00,2025-10-10 14:25:23

105,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"No matter how much we like to think that life’s bigger concerns have the greatest influence in dictating our actions, it’s nevertheless curious to see how the issues that affect us most personally – those seemingly “smaller” considerations – ultimately hold the most sway over our behavior. That becomes apparent in this latest offering from writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, based on the 1990 novel Vineland by author Thomas Pynchon. In a quasi-dystopian version of America, a battle for control of the nation’s cultural and sociopolitical direction simmers between leftist vigilante rebels known as the French 75 and conservative authoritarian figures supported by the military and quietly backed by a moneyed class of ultra-right wing White supremacists known as the Christmas Adventurers. But, despite the magnitude accorded to this struggle, in the end, events in the personal lives of the combatants’ individual operatives have more impact in steering their actions. Set over the course of nearly two decades, the story follows the interracial relationship of French 75 members Perfidia Beverly Hills (Tayana Taylor) and Pat “Rocketman” Calhoun (Leonardo DiCaprio) as they carry out various missions reminiscent of 1960s radicals. The duo is in love (sort of), but, in the wake of one of their raids on an immigration detention camp, Perfidia meets and unexpectedly takes a shine to her opponent, Colonel Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn), an encounter that leads to a tryst and unplanned pregnancy, all without Rocketman’s knowledge. Not long after Perfidia’s daughter is born, however, she leaves her partner to pursue her own rebel agenda, saddling Rocketman with the care of a daughter that he thinks is his. But, when Perfidia is captured by authorities, she rats out her colleagues (including Rocketman) in exchange for a spot in the witness protection program, forcing her former partner and his daughter into hiding. Skip ahead 16 years to a time when Lockjaw has an opportunity to move up in the Christmas Adventurers organization, provided he passes Caucasian purity scrutiny, a tricky proposition as the potential father of a mixed-race child. To cover his tracks on this possible “liability,” he must track down the missing child, now a teenager (Chase Infiniti), who has spent the ensuing years with her presumed dad, both of whom have assumed aliases while in hiding. And, when word of this gets back to them, they’re forced to go on the run to avoid capture (or worse). That’s easier said than done, though, given that Rocketman has developed substance abuse issues that have taken their toll on him. Fortunately, however, he’s aided by a cool, composed street smart sensei master (Benicio Del Toro) who confidently manages the affairs of the immigrant residents of a sanctuary city, having become adept at helping others stay ahead of officials. And so, despite the broader conflict going on around these characters, their priorities are almost exclusively personal as they seek to tend to their respective agendas. But can they? Thus begins a kickass thrill ride as all concerned seek to protect themselves at all costs, a story filled with great action sequences, riveting chase scenes, and mesmerizing twists and turns, with a good measure of comic relief thrown in to make it interesting. Admittedly, there are times (especially early on in the film) when the connections between the various story threads aren’t connected or made clear as well as they might have been, and Del Toro’s character and storyline feel somewhat underdeveloped. But those issues are more than compensated for by the picture’s other strengths, as well as an outstanding performance by Penn in a role in which he expertly plays against type. The film, which has a vibe somewhat reminiscent of the excellent contemporary thriller “Eddington” from earlier this year, is also surprisingly well paced for a movie with a 2:41:00 runtime, a noteworthy accomplishment, to be sure. And, like “Eddington,” this offering has drawn its share of mixed reactions from viewers and critics, probably for some of the same cultural and sociopolitical reasons as those associated with that earlier offering. However, “One Battle After Another” is truly worth the time, another fine release from a gifted filmmaker.",761,2025-11-27 12:14:33,2025-11-27 12:14:33
106,54,Review from Henry | The Reel Verdict,"Movie Review: One Battle After Another 

One Battle After Another is a masterful dark comedy-drama that skillfully balances humour with unsettling realism. The performances are compelling, and the cinematography strikingly captures both the intimacy and tension of each scene. Beneath its moments of humour lies a powerful narrative about love, resilience, and the human cost of political conflict. The film’s ability to be both enjoyable and unnerving makes it a provocative, thought-provoking experience, one that lingers long after the credits roll.

109,57,Review from Reno,"> Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.

This beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.

Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.

All kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.

So the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.

These days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.

The Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.

110,58,Review from whatowatch,"Zootopia is the latest family animation movie from Disney about a young bunny determined to be a cop at all costs  – in a land where only 'predators' are cops, she would be the first ‘prey’ cop. Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.

Zootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy’s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.

The animation is as good as a Pixar animation – perfectly made  – and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. 

The best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba. His performance should earn him an Oscar this year! No wonder it has grossed 1 Billion dollars worldwide despite little marketing. 

Rated 9 out of 10 only because we cannot give it a 10.",104,2016-08-07 11:17:07,2021-06-23 15:57:49

113,61,Review from Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.

Almost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.

The movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.

The animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.

Overall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.",779,2017-02-27 10:22:37,2024-05-16 15:21:15

It is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.

The jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof).
The voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.

116,64,Review from ahmedaiman99,"Why I find Zootopia revolutionary
==============================

1. The creative design of the titular city, and the astonishing world building.

2. Using colors and deliberately simple animation not just to make the movie appeal to children, but also to indicate the so-called ideal city of Zootopia where every animal is pure and innocent.

3. Blending more than one genre into a single animated film while keeping the plot spotless and not messy.

4. Delivering many contemporary messages and tackling some quite touchy timely themes that have never been explored in an animated film before. And by giving the priority to the center message, that of prejudice, nothing felt muddled and all over the place, since no message overshadowed the other.

5. Using the on-the-surface message (achieve one's ambition) as a characteristic of the main character (Judy Hopps), not as the actual main message. That makes this message works as a motive not as a major theme in the movie as in, for instance, Wreck-It Ralph (I LOVE it, though ♥).

6. Avoiding being over-sentimental, although Nick's character could have been easily used to manipulate our feelings.

This movie is an absolute masterpiece. Not only because its wonderful way that gives its many messages in, but also because the importance of its messages in themselves, and how smart and relevant they are. Today, children really need to be taught these morals.

The talented cast's voices fit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes littered with extremely hilarious jokes which we haven't heard before in any animated movie, or even in a live-action movie. This movie blends so many genres: Comedy, Adventure, Action, Crime, and Mystery. That said, you will never feel confused while watching it.

The characters are definitely some of the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they had, and thus makes each character has different motives and feelings.

117,13,Review from r96sk,"I like <em>'Zootopia'</em>, it's much better than I had anticipated.

First off, the animation is superb - as we expect from Disney of course, but that doesn't change the fact. Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy) leads the cast very well, while Jason Bateman gives the most memorable performance as Nick. Idris Elba and Jenny Slate (not Edie Falco or Constance Shulman, as I initially guessed... just me? Probably) are good too.

The premise is actually my favourite part of this film. I'm not saying it's anything revolutionary, but it actually feels fresh throughout - I enjoyed seeing it play out, it's paced perfectly. There's a nice <em>'Breaking Bad'</em> reference in there, too.

An entertaining 2016 animated film, one that also has a positive message. Recommended.",973,2020-09-05 16:39:14,2021-06-23 15:58:43
118,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"I Am Frankelda is Mexico’s first stop-motion animated feature film. Written, directed, and produced by Rodolfo and Arturo Ambriz, the Ambriz brothers are proteges of Guillermo del Toro and even dedicate the film to the Mexican filmmaker. The film is a Mexican production produced by Cartoon Network Latin America and Warner Bros. Discovery. 

The Ambriz brothers did a miniseries consisting of five 12-minute episodes entitled Frankelda’s Book of Spooks, which I Am Frankelda is essentially an expansion of. The series looks like it features the same characters and cinematic realms that I Am Frankelda showcases, but is more focused on the stories Frankelda has written in her book. I Am Frankelda is the origin of both Francisca Imelda in the 1870s and a disintegrating nightmare realm where she is drawn to an owl boy named Herneval. Since Frankelda’s Book of Spooks can currently be found on HBO Max, it seems like I Am Frankelda will eventually be available there. 

Francis’s imagination was troublesome for her as a child. She has always been writing, but her vivid imagination always resulted in her grandmother scolding her and encouraging her to do more feminine activities. The two realms were bridged from the beginning, with Francis’ writing being the common connection. She dreamed about the nightmare realm from a young age and wrote about it. 

Herneval is a prince whose royal family rules over the nightmare realm. His father and mother, the king and queen, are kind and compassionate, while their empathy for others is often seen as a weakness. Their realm is falling apart because there hasn’t been a decent nightmare in years. 

A giant green spider named Procustes is the royal nightmarer. He is in charge of writing horrific nightmares that would allow their realm to flourish. But Procustes hasn’t written anything in years. His time is spent trying to keep his job with mind games. Since he has had the royal nightmarer title for so long, he believes his writing ability is greater than it truly is. 

Years pass, and Herneval and Francis are now adults. Francis attempts to get published, but her horror and fantasy stories are seen as too fanciful. She is encouraged to write in a more realistic genre, like romance, and she takes it personally. She adopts the Frankelda moniker as a new pen name to continue writing as the best fantasy and horror author ever.

Herneval’s parents are now dying, and the nightmare realm is on the verge of deteriorating completely. Herneval has been following and reading Francis’ stories all this time – traveling to her realm despite it being forbidden. He wants her to be the new royal nightmarer to save his realm and his parents. Procustes becomes jealous and intends to have Frankelda write for him for eternity. 

I Am Frankelda takes a lot of inspiration from the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Neverending Story. The importance of writing and fiction is crucial to the storytelling of the film. Francis’ stories fail to make an impact in her realm, but are like a series of undiscovered gold mines in the nightmare realm. 

It’s also bizarre that the writing of the film is so elongated. I Am Frankelda is nearly two hours long, which feels like an eternity for an animated film. The film is so dialogue-heavy, as well. With so many exceptional monsters and unique creatures in the film, it feels criminal that they spend more time talking than they do being scary or menacing. 

The ending isn’t entirely satisfying either. I Am Frankelda leaves the story up in the air with a ton of unanswered plot points and major developments. It ends on a serious cliffhanger that impacts both realms simultaneously. It’s a bold move considering in this day and age, especially on a fickle streaming giant like HBO Max, that cancels fully completed Warner Bros. Films whenever the wind blows the wrong way, hinting at a sequel that may or may not come to fruition. 

For the most part, I Am Frankelda is beautiful to look at. The puppets used in the animated film are brimming with intricate details, and the film itself gushes with vibrant colors and superb lighting. In a lot of old cartoons, you can typically tell what item someone is going to interact with because it either has more detail or it's a different color. The mouths in I Am Frankelda are consistently different colors, which is a bit distracting. Many of the typical bean-shaped mouths are also flat and give off South Park or Robot Chicken vibes. 

The backgrounds are littered with the same amount of detail. The nightmare realm is surrounded by a cloud-infested sea with waving white arms and hands. Structures are made up of various colored eyeballs, talons, and wings buried inside massive tree trunks and branches. When a nightmare is written, the royal family places it on a podium next to a tree with cobwebs inside. The cobwebs are then used as a harp to play the freshly written nightmares. 

There are incredible, spooky elements throughout I Am Frankelda. A crocodile fishing in the cloud sea is seen moments later with its flesh dissolving from its bones. The nightmare realm features nasty perfection like a two-headed griffin, a mammoth skeleton, and a blindfolded magic coyote. The film is a visual feast for animation fans. 

A story worth telling is told in a roundabout way that would benefit from being much more concise. I Am Frankelda needed an editor or a ghost writer to tighten things up. The film feels like it’s about 15-20 minutes too long. Overall, I Am Frankelda is an animated triumph that is a bit rough around the edges.",819,2025-08-05 02:07:37,2025-08-05 02:07:37
119,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Whilst I do reckon that the cinema is a great place for this kind of vibrant and action-packed animation, it’s not so important for the stories here as this spends quite a while abridging what are quite clearly previous storylines before teeing us up for an introduction to the new curse-laden grudge matches that are to play out in the next series. Now that’s hardly new, but at least the “Demon Slayer” films try to present more stand-alone movies that offer us something a lot more self-contained. This doesn’t, and so if you don’t already know about the story thus far, nor of the sources of the bitterness, rancour and alliances between “Otadori”, “Gojo”, my own favourite “Okkotsu” et al then this won’t really advance your knowledge much and really only serves as a tease. That said, there are still plenty of metamorphosing slug-like critters with huge teeth, brutal combat scenes that test the mortality of just about everyone and it’s got a soundtrack that works well in helping the pace rollick along. It’s a decent watch, but to make much sense of the continuing characterisations it is really only for regular fans of the series - and I suspect they will have seen it all before.",599,2025-11-19 18:47:39,2025-11-19 18:56:47
120,5,Review from MovieGuys,"Kate Beckinsale's lead character, Ada is about as intimidating as a bag of spinach, in this truly awful, tough girl action flick. 

There is little to like here. An unoriginal story with a dash of casual misandry, meets what could best be described, as an unintentional satire of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". 

Perhaps the only upside, is the actions not wholly bad but it doesn't really make up, for this films deficits, in most other respects.

In summary, yet another hammy girl boss action flick, no one asked for, much less wanted.",812,2025-11-29 04:07:40,2025-12-05 22:25:17

122,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"“Grace” (Jennifer Lawrence) and boyfriend “Jackson” (Robert Pattinson) arrive at the remote Montana home that used to belong to his uncle. She’s not exactly enamoured of the place but they are so loved up that it is quickly a case of getting down to things on the wooden flooring and making themselves a bairn. Thing is, though, once motherhood beckons “Grace” begins to feel the full effects of their isolation. With “Jackson” at work, often far away, she finds herself bored and captivated by their married and motor-cycle riding neighbour “Karl” (LaKeith Stanfield). After the birth, what appears to be some post-natal trauma sets in and neither her boyfriend nor his mother “Pam” (Sissy Spacek) who has had her own troubled experiences with her now late husband (Nick Nolte) can really get to grips with her increasingly erratic, often sex-obsessed, behaviour. It doesn’t exactly help the situation that “Jackson” has no longer any interest in the sexual nature of their relationship and so a chasm is slowly but definitely developing between the pair. Is anything redeemable for them? Do they care? Do we? This film belongs to a Lawrence who is remarkably free with her performance. She portrays her character effectively, depicting senses of confusion and ennui, sexuality and desire really quite powerfully and in a fashion that is quite potently foiled by the sparing appearances of Spacek. Pattinson, though, is just about as wooden as their picket fence and here I could not quite decide if he was cast because he is not a remotely charismatic actor and because Lynne Ramsay wanted this film to be solely about the character of “Grace”; or whether he was meant to add more weight than he actually does and just isn’t very good. It identifies some elements of mental illness, but there is little context or science for us to grasp the extent to which she might be genuinely ill, or just attention seeking? If the latter, then what might have broken their relationship? It’s a smudgy film. Deliberately, I guess, with some plot lines clear, others blurred and some missing altogether - but I found that emotional ambiguity increasingly uninteresting as the plot unravels to no apparent purpose. Perhaps I just wasn’t on the same wavelength, but I didn’t really get anything from this remarkably soulless story. Sorry.",895,2025-11-13 19:30:40,2025-11-13 19:41:04

124,66,Review from Sejian,"I enjoyed this movie, but boy do I have issues with the storytelling and the glamorizing of K-pop idols' lives.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

1. Rumi was born part-demon, right? Her mother was a demon hunter and her father was a demon, which implies that not all demons are evil, right? Yes? No? We are never told how Rumi's mother died and we are never told what happened to Rumi's father, but I highly doubt that Rumi's mother was tricked into a relationship by a demon long enough to have a child.
2. All demons are supposed to be banished when the Honmoon is sealed, so how the heck is the cat and the crow still there, also, why do we even have a demon cat and crow? They're cute, but what are they? Are there ""true demons"" like Gwi-Ma, the cat and the crow, and ""enslaved demons"" like Jinu and his boy band?
3. Gwi-Ma enslaves other demons and practically tortures them with their shame for all eternity and we end the movie by permanently trapping them all in the demon realm with him? Really? Even though Jinu shows that demons can be redeemed by... showing them kindness and forgiveness?! REALLY?! Okay!

The last one is my biggest issue with the plot.

As for my issues with the representation of K-pop idols; their lives are only glamorous on the surface. K-pop idols are not born, they're made.

These kids go through hell, for lack of a better way to describe it. It's not so much an issue with the K-pop industry itself, as it's a ""cultural"" issue. Koreans push themselves and each other to the brink, and it can and does lead to suicide.

South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

The movie shows our K-pop protagonists snacking out and enjoying life, when in reality, these kids are on a strict diet and are allegedly not allowed these things.

I like the movie, but I've read too much about the real lives of K-pop idols to overlook the glamorized misrepresentation shown here.",574,2025-06-24 13:25:31,2025-06-24 13:26:38

127,44,Review from Nick,"KPop Demon Hunters is a visual and musical treat that takes you on a wild ride through a world inspired by K-pop, anime, and the Spider-Verse. The animation is so colorful and creative that it’s like a kaleidoscope explosion! The music is catchy and upbeat, and the story is layered with depth and emotion. Arden Cho and the rest of the voice cast do amazing jobs bringing the characters to life. The main character, Rumi, is on a journey of self-discovery, and it’s really heartwarming to see how much they grow and learn. The film does have a few minor flaws, like some uneven tones and underdeveloped secondary characters, but overall, it’s a fun and entertaining fantasy parody of pop culture. It’s a must-watch for anyone who loves K-pop, anime, and just great storytelling.",638,2025-08-17 07:54:04,2025-08-29 22:16:08

Yes, there have been rave reviews for this movie, but we recommend that you do not mind them, as we should not be teaching children on how to safely get sodomized by a monster.

These directors' brains are also in the trash. Now let's put the MPAA R rating right into the trash where it is supposed to go. Final warning: **Don't let your kids watch trash.**",871,2017-09-18 12:05:00,2021-06-23 15:58:01
130,60,Review from Gimly,"More _Fucked-Up-Coming-of-Age_ than _Monster-Movie-Slasher-Horror_. Which is what it should be, but perhaps not what it's marketed to be. Stephen King's _It_ is one of my all time favourite books, and I don't know that it will ever get a faithful adaptation (totally understandable seeing as the thing is 1200 pages and contains a multi-book spanning mythology of Space Gods and Turtle vomit), but this does a pretty good job of interpreting the feeling of the novel, even if it's not a great adaptation the events as a whole.

The kids are all great, Skarsgård makes for a good Pennywise, Pennywise improves as the piece moves forward, and the town is completely believable as ""Derry"" in the '80s. It may not be all it's purported to be, but is a very impressive film on its own merits.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._",923,2017-09-19 04:11:22,2021-06-23 15:58:01

132,71,Review from Frank Ochieng,"Something certainly rings true in the horror thriller **It** that capitalizes on that common known fear that clowns are creepy annoyances to those that have an intense phobia towards them. In the case of **It’s** dastardly powder-faced joyboy or shall we say corrosive killjoy Pennywise the Dancing Clown, he definitely takes the cake in terms of his treacherous tendencies to quiet the unsuspecting kiddies in devious fashion. Here is a tip, parents, do not invite the poisonous Pennywise to your kids’ birthday party any time soon to blow up balloons and sing songs. This is just a friendly little warning. There is more to elaborate on regarding the sicko circus funnypants freak later.

Director Andy Muschietti (‘Mama’) delves into this surprisingly delicious twisted and terrorizing tale of a killer clown that gets his jollies off snuffing the lives out of rural-based youngsters in this calculating frightfest that pushes all the right buttons of panic and perversion. Skilfully edgy and traumatically tasty, **It** is a refreshing throwback to old-fashioned gory-minded gems where the boundaries of old-fashioned scare tactics were designed not only by the actual act of homicidal happenings but the mere suggestive nature of the heinous hedonism taking place. Polished and gripping in its shadowy and shifty overtones, **It** is convincingly probing as an absorbing psychological character study with an off-kilter sense of defiance in its naughty commentary on youthful innocence being compromised.

Based on the novel from famed hair-raising author Stephen King, **It** delivers the solid, sordid goods of a wild and wicked imagination following the acidic exploits of a menacing clown in the aforementioned Pennywise (played with penetrating  and devilish aplomb by Bill Skarsgard from ‘Atomic Blonde’) whose murderous methods of slaughtering the young has been a staple signature in his madness for centuries now. The surviving tykes in the quaint town of Derry, Maine must now safeguard themselves from the makeup-wearing whackjob and figure out a way to terminate the baggy-panted beast before he continues to strike again and victimize another doomed child.

The backstory behind Pennywise’s existence is that he is some shape-shifting demon that emerges from the sewers only to target the unlucky rugrat in his immediate path while conniving, and conducting his blood-thirsty ways. However, there are a group of children that refuse to play dead for the demented clown and the quest to create an ill-advised showdown with the deplorable Pennywise would prove to be a very violent and mentally scarring experience in the process.

The story centres around young Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, ‘Allegiant’) and his early encounter with the sadness of unknowingly witnessing Pennywise’s wrath as it was inferred that the clown had to do with the demise of his precious little brother, George (Jackson Robert Scott), who never returned after enthusiastically wanting to work on a fun project in the basement. This haunting revelation sticks with poor Bill until this very day.

Nowadays, Bill must cope with the typical obstacles at school avoiding bullies and dealing with the pitfalls of peer pressure and needing to belong to a group of trusty associates. Thus, Bill is able to cement close relationships with the town’s other free-spirited youngsters. Still, there is that hovering myth about the mysterious sewers and, yes, the evil-minded Pennywise is at the forefront of fearful concern for Bill and the bunch. In fact, the gang will succumb to their collection of fears, paranoia and hesitation as the suburban legend of the creep-seeking clown clouds each of the kids’ tainted psyches.

The ensemble of young actors in **It**  all register accordingly with their characters’ childhood shock in trying to overcome the overwhelming and petrifying mindset that has invaded their sensibilities. Lieberher has an authentic raw turn as the lead lad invested in the bizarre boundaries of matching wits with the demonic chalk-skinned trickster and his committed craziness. The other supporting cast of exposed kiddies on this adventurous train wreck of terror includes Sophia Lillis (’37’), Finn Wolfhard (from television’s ‘Stranger Things’), Jeremy Ray Taylor (‘Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Road Chip’), Wyatt Oleff (‘Guardians Of The Galaxy”), Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer (‘Tales Of Halloween’) and Nicholas Hamilton (‘Captain Fantastic’).

There is no doubt that Skarsgard’s clown of corrosion in Pennywise steals the show with his nefarious nature blistering shamelessly in seedy-minded elation. Clearly, Skarsgard chews the tarnished scenery with his abominable costumed cretin tip toeing on the unassuming sidelines while striking gory goosebump moments for his pubescent prey on screen and the twitchy audience off screen.

Sure, **It** suffers from the conventional trappings of cheesy false alarm jolts and the obligatory lurking in the dark sequences are arbitrarily tossed in as an aftermath for the legitimate lunacy of our star-making crazed and corruptible clown to perform his showboating insanity. Besides, what horror showcase has not welcomed the invitation of the overused and abused jump-scare techniques highlighted by a jittery soundtrack? Still, Muschietti and screenwriters Chase Palmer, Cary Joji Funkunga and Gary Dauberman manage to supply the infectious and insidious **It** with well-executed scary shenanigans, well-paced anxiety, wavering vulnerability and decent acting on behalf of the performers that aptly brought to life the eerie visions and vitality of King’s complex, creative mind.

Truly **It** is one of the best harrowing and in-depth horror/psychological thrillers to emerge in 2017. Also this titillating tale of cautionary kiddie chaos may be one of King’s formidable movie adaptions since the effective tension-filled, off-the-wall brilliance of 1990’s _Misery_.

133,72,Review from accioconnor,"It is a movie that looked interesting, but I wasn't necessarily anticipating, because it had the potential to be awful. After seeing it, I can say that while it is good, I don't think it's nearly as good as other people are saying it is, and it had the potential to be. Starting off with the good, the film has some fantastic performances from the kids. I think the best performances in the film are from Andy Skaarsgard (or however you spell it) for Pennywise, and the kid who had asthma. I don't know his name, and I haven't seen him in anything before, but he stole the show. The movie also has some pretty scary moments. The scene inside of the house is one of the scariest scenes of the year, and there are lost of images that were genuinely disturbing. While the films was full of cheesy dialogue, the conversations between the kids are extremely entertaining and captivating. When it came to characters, MOST of the characters are well done and fleshed out. And that leads me to one of the 4 things that keep this film from being great in my eyes. Some characters, such as the bullies and Stan, and bland and have no back story. Therefore, whenever they are put in danger, it isn't nearly as scary as with other characters. Another reason I didn't love this film is the rock fight scene. Basically, the Losers Club stumbles upon the bullies and they throw rocks at each other. The rocks seemingly bounce off of their head without any problems like a trampoline. No one gets killed, or even knocked out. Overall, it was a very bad scene. For the most part the special effects were pretty good. However, the leper outside of the creepy house was awful. The costume would be great if it were for a haunted house or prank, but not for a big budgeted horror movie. When it came on screen I literally thought it was a bully playing tricks on him. And the last problem I have with the film is that the police are seemingly nowhere, along with parents. *Mild spoilers* One of the bullies murders his dad, a police officer, and then around a few scenes later, the son dies too. The bullies like to go around thereatening kids with knives and carving H's into their bellies. I think we would see at least one police officer investegating something in the film, and if not, I think my parents would notice if one day I came home and there was a gigantic blood pool on my shirt. Overall, It is a very fun movie. There are certainly better movies out there, but with this, I have an urge to go watch it again in theaters. It is a perfectly fun popcorn flick.

136,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Every 27 years, the town of Derry experiences sudden, violent and inexplicable mayhem. In 1989, a group of school children rather unkindly called ""The Losers Club"" decide it is for them to investigate just what has happened. Led by ""Bill"" (Jaeden Martell) whose younger brother was a victim, these brave kids are soon on the trail of the shapeshifting ""Pennywise"" - a being from another dimension who frequently takes the shape of a clown. Question is - are these youngsters any match for this lethal and despicable foe? Andy Muschietti has done well here with this film. He manages to combine the more traditional spookiness of the old dark house, with a group of likeable characters who demonstrate the benefits of trust and teamwork as they take on this evil. As with most good horror films, the seemingly invincible must have a weakness, otherwise the plot becomes unsustainable - and this one allows the youngsters to define and exploit this whilst still maintaining enough shock moments and sense of menace to keep the thing interesting. The dialogue isn't the best, but that is not so important here - it's still a really well paced and genuinely scary story that engenders fear from something so outwardly benign as a clown - normally the symbol of joy and happiness. I rarely jump at the cinema nowadays, but this does work!",863,2024-05-29 15:32:33,2024-05-29 15:32:33

138,37,Review from John Chard,"Dream work indeed. 

An alien is stranded on Earth and a bunch of suburban kids attempt to help him get home.

It's amazing to think that such a simple and standard story would go on to become a global phenomenon. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, directed by Steven Spielberg, blasted its way into pop culture and simultaneously became one of the most cherished films of all time. It's not hard to see why, for E.T. appeals to every member of the family, from the joyous set ups as E.T. stumbles around middle America suburbia, to the doses of magic so gleefully constructed by Spielberg's inner child. Those wishing to scratch away at the surface (and there are many who have previously) will find Spielberg affecting his picture with divorce subtexts (his parents divorce was known to upset him deeply), whilst the government ""villains"" show an astute aside to paranoia of the times and suspicions of political operatives.

Dee Wallace, Henry Thomas, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore and Peter Coyote star. The score, now famous and likely to bring about goose bumps with at the opening bars, is from John Williams, with cinematography coming from Allen Daviau. Shown in the main from a child's perspective, the film is still a wonder that charms and informs on repeat viewings. So much so that as it approaches its 40th birthday, its longevity and all encompassing appeal shows no sign of abating. Something that Spielberg and his crew can rightly feel very proud about. 9/10",803,2020-04-13 22:38:35,2024-05-16 15:22:28

140,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Some aliens stop by to collect some plant samples. They are spooked by people, flashing lights and dogs investigating the noise and flee - but they accidentally leave one of their number behind. This youngster takes refuge in the shed of a local family where he is discovered by the young ""Elliott"" (Henry Thomas) and soon the two have a special bond. Gradually the rest of his family are introduced, and they try to figure out how to get him home. Can they succeed before the ever vigilant authorities cotton on? This is just one of these films that is genuinely timeless. It's a love story, a sci-fi adventure, a tale of family, longing and loyalty - all set to superb John Williams score. The chase on the bikes is the stuff of cinema legend, as is ""phone home"" and the sight of the little creature all dragged-up. The acting from the human youngsters is great, with Drew Barrymore's (""Gertie"") and Robert MacNaughton as their elder brother (""Michael"") all contributing well to a charming story that even now, 40 years later, is still one of the best cinema has to offer. It works OK on telly, but for best effect seek it out on a big screen - it's still well worth that.",150,2023-06-08 07:54:10,2023-06-08 07:54:10
141,77,Review from Ravi,"The Carpenter’s Son is a film that makes a strong first impression, but ultimately stumbles where it matters most: the story. The production excels technically — the visual adaptation is stunning, with symbolic religious imagery and dark, atmospheric cinematography that pulls the viewer into the film’s harsh desert environment. The sound design and musical score are equally impressive, adding tension and depth to every scene. From an audiovisual standpoint, the movie is exceptional.

The problem begins when the narrative takes over. The film attempts to adapt elements from the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, but the result is a storyline that feels confusing, uneven, and at times incoherent. It flirts with deep themes like faith, fear, guilt, and destiny, yet fails to develop any of them in a meaningful way. More often than not, the movie seems more focused on provoking than on delivering a cohesive or compelling plot.

Nicolas Cage delivers an intense performance, as expected, but even his presence isn’t enough to stabilize a script that collapses under its own ambition. The overall feeling is that the premise had tremendous potential, but the execution ends up fragmented, leaving audiences more puzzled than thoughtful.

In short: The Carpenter’s Son is technically excellent, with outstanding visuals and sound, but its story — already described by many as confusing — weakens the final impact. It’s a film that grabs attention, but doesn’t quite earn lasting admiration.",191,2025-11-15 18:58:35,2025-11-30 17:56:55

144,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"Whenever a film playing in theaters is introduced by one of the members of the picture’s creative team, it’s a safe bet that it doesn’t live up to its pre-release hype. (Indeed, in all the years I’ve watched movies theatrically, that’s been the case every time with just two exceptions.) And, regrettably, that’s very much the case in this final installment in this long-running franchise. To put it simply, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” is an offering with a lot of problems, the biggest of which being the decision to split the story into two parts in the first place. As it stands, the narrative could have easily been condensed down to a single release. But, if the producers truly wanted to make two films to close out the franchise, they could have readily done so by making two distinct stand-alone pictures instead of trying to tie this offering to its predecessor, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One” (2023), considering that the nexus between them is tepid at best. As a consequence, though, this two-film package makes for a needlessly long 5½-hour story that could have been told in much less time with some judicious editing. This suggests that milking the box office had to have been a strong incentive for how this project ultimately played out. And, even if that wasn’t the case, the least the creators could have done was to tell a better story: While the first part did a reasonably capable job of holding viewer interest, that’s out the window here with its many well-crafted but decidedly overlong action sequences (a la the most recent “Indiana Jones” offering (2023)); a story that elevates comparatively minor characters to unexplained relevance; under-utilizes the talents of several gifted cast members (e.g., Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer) while leaving others out entirely (where’s Vanesa Kirby’s White Widow, a character who played a key role in the first part?); and requires comprehensive audience familiarity with both the franchise’s complete mythology, as well as in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of AI technology. Most importantly, however, many plot elements of the picture go beyond being “impossible” to “wholly implausible” or even “difficult to accept,” with numerous scenes that are full of holes, rely on convenient contrivances or seem completely unfathomable. “Final Reckoning” even “borrows” elements from other movie narratives (most notably “Fail Safe” (1964) and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991)) that strain its efforts at originality. There’s also an almost self-congratulatory aspect to the production thanks to the inclusion of numerous flashback clips to previous installments in the franchise, introduced with somewhat tangential tie-ins, a cinematic stroll down memory lane that adds little (the film’s inspired reintroduction and effective use of CIA operative William Donloe (Rolf Saxon) from the franchise’s first release (1996) notwithstanding). In the end, however, this release misses the mark in myriad ways, and that even includes a rather lame conclusion that comes across as stretched out and unsatisfyingly anticlimactic (and that could have been handled better and differently in several alternate scenarios). In my view, this collection of blatant shortcomings is not the way to wrap up a storied franchise like this. I firmly believe that it should have come to an end with the release of “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” (2018), handily the best of the eight features in this series. Indeed, going to the well one (or two!) too many times can tarnish a mythology’s legacy, and “Mission: Impossible” is one such venture. It genuinely deserves to go out with a bang and not a whimper. Unfortunately, though, in this case, the latter is the reality, and that’s truly a shame.",957,2025-05-25 01:02:32,2025-05-26 00:22:33
145,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"It might have been a good idea for Tom Cruise to have re-released the first part of this career retrospective a few weeks ago so we could be reminded of just what was in the submarine perched precariously on a subterranean ridge in the Arctic - because I had totally forgotten what happened last time around. Quickly, though, we are reminded that the entity (anyone see the “Forbin Project” from 1970?) is bent on seizing control of the world’s nuclear arsenals and using them to start a process of mutually assured destruction that will eradicate all life on Earth. Luckily “Ethan” (Cruise) has the magic key that might lead to humanity’s salvation, but he also needs the support of his erstwhile bosses, the President of the USA, an aircraft carrier and a nuclear submarine that actually works. Once we have waded through all the recaps the story kicks in with plenty of opportunity for our ingenious hero and his team - largely without Ving Rhames this time - to put together a series of cunning plays and counter-plays to keep themselves ahead of not just the megalomaniacal virus but also the malevolent “Gabriel” (Esai Morales) who reckons he might be able to take control. It’s essentially a vehicle for the star for the supporting efforts from the likes of Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg offer us little of distinction, but if you’re a fan of action adventure movies then this is the equivalent of a higher-tech “Indiana Jones” movie with car chases; loads of pyrotechnics; great visual effects, an energetic score and it culminates with an enjoyable aerial dogfight that just needed the Red Baron and/or Sir Sean Connery. I am struggling to believe this is really the last of these, but if it is then it’s a fitting denouement for a character that has largely delivered well these last thirty years and that has has come along way from the Peter Graves stuff from the late 1960s. It does need a big screen as it will look very ordinary on the television, but even though it is probably half an hour longer than it needs to be, is still a good watch.",227,2025-05-29 13:32:02,2025-05-29 13:34:30
146,10,Review from JPV852,"Solid entry (final?) of the franchise and while not the strongest in terms of plot (has the same issue that I had with Dead Reckoning), the stunt work (most notably the submarine and airplane sequences) were top notch. Probably wasn't in the budget but would've loved to had cameos of past IMF members. Oh, and the twist of one of the characters seemed a bit of a stretch and probably not what they had in mind when writing/filming MI:DR. **3.75/5**

147,13,Review from r96sk,"<em>'Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning'</em> is up there for being the most I've enjoyed a M:I movie, it's certainly in the top four anyway. It probably is a touch overlong, though I can't say I ever felt bored through the 2hrs 50mins. It's packed with action, so no surprise.

Tom Cruise is, as we've seen across the prior seven installments, excellent in the role of Ethan Hunt. Those with him here are very good, but there's no doubt Cruise is the glue. Speaking of the rest, Ving Rhames gets a nice arc, while Hannah Waddingham and Tramell Tillman have good bits.

It was never* one of my favourite franchises, but I still enjoyed every entry of <em>'Mission: Impossible'</em> to a fairly high level; fwiw, I scored every release at 8/10 - a very consistent series, evidently. Happy I (belatedly) got to see one of 'em on the big screen too.

148,14,Review from Chandler Danier,"How can we have a final reckoning when the last bit of the movie is dedicated to letting us know that Ethan Hunt is definitely still important and definitely will be back doing stuff. Give it up, Tom.

There are some bad CG effects in here. Unforgivable.

This movie is long and full of dumb shit that doesn't matter. Everyone knows everyone because Ethan is so good at being better than everyone but we need to know this through a bunch of flashbacks.  They had so much time, in fact, we get another bomb, another self sacrifice...wait...3 people sacrifice oh my god. 3 people we've never met and don't care about are going to die by the second bomb...everyone just clipping wires and removing nodes like it don't matter! Oh wait, everyone lives! Thank god. I'm glad that took about 30 minutes of movie run time. Now for 30 minutes of flying. 


Don't think I just spoiled the movie. There are about 300 more minutes for you to experience! ",398,2025-08-20 20:06:11,2025-08-20 20:19:20

150,5,Review from MovieGuys,"Generally speaking I've enjoyed the ""Mission Impossible"" films. I believe Tom Cruise has shone in the lead role, with a range of adventurous, action packed stories, worth telling. Its regrettable then that I can't find anything overly positive to say about ""Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning."" 

I found the script for this film incoherent. From a storytelling perspective, it wanders about like a inebriated night clubber on a Saturday night. Its not helped either by a  weak core premise and villains who are, put simply, really none too interesting.

On the upside Cruise does his best and the action scenes are polished, as you would expected from a big budget film.

In summary, to my mind the least inspiring film, in the Mission Impossible franchise. Maybe its time it had its cinematic ""final reckoning"" and was shelved, for the foreseeable future.",998,2025-08-24 07:50:41,2025-08-30 23:41:56
151,80,Review from jackmeat,"My quick rating - 7.2/10. You’d think a 170-minute movie would have plenty of time to waste, but Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning sprints out of the gate and doesn’t look back. For something that clocks in at nearly three hours, it’s almost shocking how quickly it moves. The story is intricate, packed with moving parts, but still surprisingly easy to follow. Credit goes to the sharp editing that threads everything together without losing momentum. It’s clear the filmmakers wanted this to feel like the culmination of Ethan Hunt’s thirty-year journey, and in many ways, they pull it off—though maybe not quite as hard-hitting as one might expect from a grand finale.

Of course, the real selling point here is the action. Tom Cruise once again takes every opportunity to play Mr. Show-Off with his stunt work, and honestly, I’m not mad about it. Whether it’s leaping off impossible heights, riding vehicles where no sane person would, or holding his breath longer than a Navy SEAL, Cruise continues to prove he’s Hollywood’s most committed daredevil. Sure, the Fast and Furious franchise gets ribbed for ridiculous, physics-defying set pieces, but let’s not kid ourselves—the Mission: Impossible films are guilty of the exact same thing. The difference is, these stunts are both insane and staged so well you can’t help but buy in.

The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. There are shots here that are simply jaw-dropping, and the underwater submarine sequence is a masterclass in tension. It’s one of those rare moments where I completely forgot the film’s narrative hiccups because I was so locked in. This is the kind of spectacle that demands the biggest screen possible, and it delivers on that front without question.

That said, there are issues. For one, the script leans heavily on exposition, so much so that I occasionally wanted to yell, “Enough talking, just throw Tom Cruise off another cliff already!” And while it’s fun to see familiar faces like Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg return, the film introduces so many additional characters that several of them feel like nothing more than pawns shuffled around the board. They’re there to keep the plot moving, not to give us anyone new to root for.

Then there’s the villain problem. Gabriel, played by Esai Morales, makes for a sinister presence, but his routine is frustratingly repetitive. He shows up, threatens or mansplains something, then disappears until the next scene, where he does the same thing again. It’s hard to feel the weight of the supposed ultimate adversary when his menace keeps fading into the background.

And that brings me to the finale. For a movie carrying the subtitle “The Final Reckoning,” it doesn’t quite land the emotional haymaker I was expecting. It’s still thrilling, still entertaining, but it doesn’t pack the kind of gut punch you’d hope for from the end of a thirty-year saga.

Even with those flaws, I can’t deny this is a wildly entertaining blockbuster. The tension, the stunts, the sheer spectacle—it’s everything you’d expect from a Mission: Impossible film, even if it stops just shy of greatness. Respect where it’s due: Tom Cruise keeps raising the bar, and for that alone, this ride is worth taking.",41,2025-08-29 09:25:43,2025-08-29 22:13:52

""Wicked: For Good may not reach the levels of the first film, but it remains a wonderful work of technical excellence and profound emotional impact.

The audiovisual spectacle is complemented by the urgency of its social commentary on political propaganda and, most crucially, by the unbreakable heart of its friendship story.

154,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"Splitting a single story into two movies is a risky production decision that sometimes pays off and sometimes doesn’t. Is it truly merited artistically speaking, or is it simply an attempt at an unabashed box office money grab? When the creators of the cinematic adaptation of the smash hit Broadway musical Wicked announced in 2022 that they would be depicting the material through two films, the decision was met with somewhat mixed reactions. Could the pictures each stand alone despite being parts of the same story? Would the first installment be strong enough to retain audience interest over time before the release of the second part (in this case, a year, far longer than a typical Broadway intermission)? And would there be a distinct enough connection to seamlessly tie the two movies together? Those are among just a few of the potential pitfalls typically associated with a production decision like this. In this case, however, the move has appeared to pay off, both creatively and monetarily. The extra time taken to tell the story here has effectively facilitated a better understanding of the narrative and the nature of its characters than the original stage play, which was often criticized for throwing too much content at audiences too quickly, making it hard to follow. And, while this second part doesn’t have quite the same spark as its 2024 predecessor, it’s still a capable, polished effort thanks to its fine production design, stirring musical numbers and stellar performances. As for the somewhat diminished luster, that could be due to the fact that the material in this second act (as in the play itself) is darker and more serious than, and not quite as well organized as, part one, with decidedly fewer laughs and less overall whimsy. It could also be that the novelty of the first film has worn off in the time since its release a year ago, understandable for material as distinctive as this. Whatever the case, though, “Wicked: For Good” nevertheless presents an entertaining, enjoyable and at times enlightening tale, continuing the story of the two principals, Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande-Butera) and Elphaba, now known as the Wicked Witch of the West (Cynthia Erivo), the onetime best friends who have been divided by the nefarious maneuverings of the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) and the evil Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh). As the story threads of this quartet unfold, the film also picks up and substantively elaborates upon the roles of several supporting characters whose participation wasn’t always made clear in the first installment, giving them an opportunity to shine in their own right. This includes the plotlines involving Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), Nessa’s romantic interest, Boq (Ethan Slater), and the charming, if conflicted, Prince Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey). It also opens the door to introducing characters from this work’s original cinematic source material, “The Wizard of Oz” (1939), including unexpectedly transplanted farmgirl Dorothy Gale (Bethany Weaver) and her sidekicks, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion (voiced by Colman Domingo), players who figure significantly in the overall narrative but are incorporated here without becoming overly intrusive. Admittedly, viewers may not find this offering from director Jon M. Chu quite as enthralling as “Wicked: Part 1” (2024), but it’s far from the unfairly overblown disappointment that some have expressed about it. For what it’s worth, “Wicked: For Good” once again proves that tales of life over the rainbow don’t disappoint, making us feel like warmly welcomed visitors who come to believe that there’s truly no place like our collective second home.",951,2025-11-23 01:26:16,2025-11-23 04:46:55
155,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Perhaps it’s just my own innate inverse reaction to hype, but boy was I underwhelmed by this. It was always going to be the harder film to make an impression, given it’s a prequel to “Wizard of Oz” and is therefore somewhat boxed in from a plot perspective. Anyway,  “Elphaba” (Cynthia Erivo) has had to flee from “Oz” leaving her friend “Galinda” (Ariana Grande-Butera) playing the role of the goody-goody for the wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and his hench-witch “Madame Morrible” (Michelle Yeoh). “Elphie” is determined to prove to the people that their leader is a fraud, but with the local population perfectly content with his governance, she has quite a battle on her hands. Indeed, the more she attempts to expose him, the less popular and more feared she becomes. Meantime, “Galinda” is set to wed “Fiyero” (Jonathan Bailey), the dashing captain of the guards - only we and he know that his heart is set on another, and she is fairly green with envy! With the animals all fleeing as if it were “Narnia” on fire, the yellow brick road being more of a conduit to oppression than to freedom and the menacing flying monkeys enforcing the wizard’s will - what chance our feisty outcast can save the day and get her guy? The visuals are terrific, but the rest of it is positively mundane. We have to wait for virtually two hours for anything akin to a killer song like “No Good Deed” or “For Good” otherwise we are presented with some not especially creatively choreographed dance numbers set to songs that are definitely not from amongst Stephen Schwartz’s finest. It has half a dozen goes at ending, and really does string that process out for twenty minutes or so that I felt just prolonged the film for the sake of it. Erivo and Grande-Butera do both know how to sing and unlike so many power-balladeers they deliver with a sense of soul, not just one of “hey, listen to my impressive vocal range”, and with Bailey providing some eye-candy and the underused Goldblum helping to steal the scene on “Wonderful” this does have some saving graces, but maybe I’m just immune to the fuss about a story that I found really quite weak and over-stretched. It looks great on a big screen, and maybe there are some subliminal messages about modern day (American) governance and the values of friendship and loyalty, but I just didn’t love it.",621,2025-11-27 09:57:59,2025-11-27 15:04:52

157,82,Review from SWITCH.,"‘It Chapter 2’ isn’t as stable or as refined a film as its predecessor, and while it feels lacking by comparison, it’s still far better than most studio horror films. It’s epic, ambitious, crazy, witty and unafraid to go for the heart as well as the throat. As a whole, this adaptation of maybe Stephen King’s greatest work feels singular in the landscape of modern horror cinema: two films built on strong interconnected relationships spread over decades, as sentimental as they are vicious, and executed on the scale of a fantasy epic. They also may be amongst the best adaptations of King’s work, understanding what makes his writing (and this novel in particular) so horrifying and so arresting, the human horror amongst the fantastical. Andy Muschietti aimed big with ‘It’, and even in the moments its reach exceeds its grasp, you’re still so glad it reached so high in the first place.

158,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

So, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year’s best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director’s chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema…

Well, I got to be honest: I’m disappointed. It’s not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn’t even come close to its predecessor’s heels. I disagree with some headlines I’ve read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There’s barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn’t as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.

Some say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film’s runtime, especially if it’s over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There’s more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that’s funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain’s (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn’t help the pacing.

The first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they’re doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it’s pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie’s subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn’t have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.

Beverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little “kid” who’s scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn’t do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017’s movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.

Finally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it’s a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn’t have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it’s pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great… 

James McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsgård had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn’t have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsgård since there’s so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.

Andy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman’s screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions. 

In the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn’t as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there’s excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it’s … okay.

162,84,Review from Matthew Brady,"“You lied and I died!”

Making us proud Georgie.

I re-watched the 1990 mini-series and 2017 remake last month in preparation for this movie in terms of judging in quality. The 90's version had it moments, but I find some scenes unintentionally funny where it reeked of early Stephen King adaptations. 2017 was surprisingly good and a massive improvement, but laid back on cheap thrills.

‘IT: Chapter Two’ was a tough act to follow up on after the monster success of the first and with the second chapter being the hardest to adapt. I thought the movie both succeeds and stumbles in parts. Although reflecting back makes it feel more like a parody than a serious horror movie. An epic finale that ended in a over the top fashion - with themes of childhood trauma and the idea of holding on to the past despite growing up with age are sprinkled through out. The loser club are all grown up now and returning home to kill IT.

Whoever cast the grow up version of the loser club deserves massive praise here, because it’s pitch perfect casting and I could definitely see the child stars growing up to be the adult stars. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, and Isaiah Mustafa were all great in bringing the more dramatic aspects to the film. While Bill Hader and James Ranson bring the comedic aspects, but not to say they weren't dramatic as well, even making me tear up at one point.

Bill Skarsgard was truly amazing as Pennywise. The physicality in his movement has a certain silliness that you would expect to see from a clown, yet predatory with his animal-like attacks with drool running down his mouth and eyes staring in opposite directions despite looking straight at you. I find the dancing clown incredibly terrifying whenever he becomes playful and kind to deceive children.

Andy Muschietti truly shines as a director when it comes to bizarre imagery and unsettling camera angles, while also capturing some real emotions through the lens. The opening scene at the bridge where a homophobic attack takes place was really brutal and starts the movie off strong - on par with the Georgie meets Pennywise scene in the first movie.

Despite the run time being nearly three hours long, but I can’t recall ever being bored. It moved at a even pace in my opinion. I guess a few scenes could’ve been cut as most of it is unused footage from the first movie. Although it would be difficult to cut scenes as everything follows up to the next scene and that emotional punch towards the end wouldn’t be earned.

Now for the issues:

Henry Bowers was completely pointless in this movie and was only used for jump scars. Same thing with Mike, who through out these movies has nothing to do and the important things he did in the book was given to different characters.

I didn’t like how Stan’s suicide was handle, because you find out he actually “sacrificed” himself to save the others.

Some of the humor didn’t always land, especially if it’s right after a tense scene where it kinda deflates the horror. At times I struggled to gasp what the film marker was going for in certain scenes. Is this scene suppose to be scary or funny? Both maybe?

I wish there was more practical work for the monster scenes instead of CGI, because at times it looked really terrible. The finale battle at the end could’ve been in a video game boss fight.

* Overall rating: Not as strong as the first, but still enjoyed it. Still, let’s kill this f**king clown.**strong text**",256,2020-01-27 18:04:36,2021-06-23 15:58:33
163,13,Review from r96sk,"A step down, but <em>'It Chapter Two'</em> is still a very good film.

It is, I will say, overly long, it did bore me a little at the midway point; not in a necessarily negative way, I just wanted more. However, it regains its footing with an entertaining ending. I'm usually not a fan of cast changes in film series, but this does it to good effect. I love the characters, whether it be in this film or the preceding entry.

Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader are great choices to play the older versions of Sophia Lillis and Finn Wolfhard, they are very convincing casts. James McAvoy is also a positive addition, while Bill Skarsgård remains enjoyable as It.

The score is, again, strong. I like the plot, even if I do feel like it's stretched out and could've had more freshness added to it. It isn't as creepy as the first film either, but still has a solid amount of uneasiness.",427,2020-12-29 16:53:39,2021-06-23 15:58:49
164,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"I watched the two films in a double bill and I really did want to enjoy this as much as I did the first - but boy, could this have been much more of a let down? The original has a far better cast; snappier direction and a much tighter script. This just rumbles along with a staccato, portmanteau-style storyline that robs the narrative of much of the cohesion of it's earlier, much more compelling, iteration. The ending is straight out of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004) without the roller skates and the pretty feeble efforts from Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy really don't help keep it on track at all!.

165,85,Review from GenerationofSwine,"How does a movie with no story become 3 hours long?

Seriously, it's a real question.

Nothing seems to happen... ever... and they virtue signal by changing a character, because you have to now... but nothing really happens for most of the movie.

And the horror felt a bit like a kids movie.

But ultimately it's 3 hours with no real plot.",264,2023-01-12 02:27:49,2023-01-12 02:27:49

167,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/keeper-review/

""Keeper is that type of movie whose personal opinion improves the more one reflects on it.

Powerful, atmospheric, and visually impactful, it not only confirms Osgood Perkins' talent in constructing dense horror environments but also features a top-tier performance from Tatiana Maslany, as well as truly unforgettable VFX-makeup work. It's psychological and folkloric horror that elevates relational toxicity to a plane of physical horror and leaves us thinking about the dynamics of control long after the lights come up.

It's a chilling descent into the nature of coercion, reminding us that the deepest terror resides in the shadows we accept and the creatures hiding within them.""

168,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"“Liz” (Tatiana Maslany) heads into the wilderness with her doctor boyfriend “Malcolm” (Rossif Sutherland) for a weekend of fun and frolicking. He has a rather more sophisticated residence than the usual cabin in the woods, and he also has a cousin who lives next door (Birkett Turton) but she is assured that he won’t bother them on their getaway. Everything seems to be going fine, they’ve even got a chocolate cake left by the caretaker, but when he has to go back into the city for a medical emergency and leave her alone for the day - well, things start going bump in the day. Is it the cake, or the red wine she has consumed? Is it just the wind rustling the foliage or her vivid imagination? Is it the enigmatic cousin “Darren”? Well, when “Malcolm” returns it soon transpires that virtually nothing in this idyllic location is as it seems, and things for her start to look fairly ominous. Technically, this is quite a spooky thriller with innovative photography and some clever use of acoustics and shadow. The story, on the other hand, is really very thin and neither actor at the sharp end of this drama really engage at all. We wait for about eighty minutes of not a lot, before a conclusion that I felt was hastily arrived at and a bit of a let down - unless maybe you were some sort of gruesome “Winnie the Pooh” after an encounter with “Grendel”. The woods are the gift that keep on giving for this mystical horror genre, but we still need some meat on the bones of the characters if we are to care one way or the other, and this is largely devoid of that.

""The Fantastic Four: First Steps not only introduces a team with the potential to lead the MCU's new era, but also establishes its own distinct identity: heartfelt, visually striking, and emotionally grounded.

Between Michael Giacchino's chilling score and the immersive retro-futuristic aesthetic - not to mention the undeniable chemistry among the four leads - there's a rare cohesion in this origin story, despite a few secondary issues.

The emotional weight in Vanessa Kirby's expressions, the intimate dilemmas faced by Pedro Pascal, and the vulnerability shown by Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach reveal an uncommon care for human detail.

If these are the first steps, they're sure-footed - and full of soul.""

172,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Well good news, after ages and having given up trying “Sue” (Vanessa Kirby) and boffin “Reed” (Pedro Pascal) are going to have a bairn! This is great news for her brother “Johnny” (Joseph Quinn) and the stony fourth member of their gang “Ben” (Egon Moss-Bacharach). The news is greeted enthusiastically by their adoring fans too, but those celebrations are cut short when a mysterious woman descends from what looks like a meteor shower to forewarn them that their planet is doomed. Her (Julia Garner) boss “Galactus” (Ralph Ineson) is on his way, and he is hungry for not just some rare earths, but all of it! Blessed with their array of super-powers, the quartet embark in their warp-capable rocket to meet this chap and he offers them an alternative to global destruction. It’s one hell of a sacrifice for the would-be parents though, but with the fate of humanity hanging on their decision - what will they choose? Perhaps they can think of a scientific alternative? There is a slightly retro-look to the production, with their flying car looking like a converted Citroën that belonged in a Jacques Tati film, and there is plenty of inter-galactic adventure with some effective visual effects, a decent degree of menace and it stays sufficiently devoid of sentiment, and the multiverse, until the denouement. Though they do gel well together, none of the acting isn’t really anything special, nor is the writing, but “Ben” looks good with his beard and Quinn probably steals the show with his engagingly flaming character and his spray-on white 501s. There are loads of gadgets and gizmos and anyone who has ever had to argue with a child seat and a car might empathise, too. It’s an old-fashioned save the world movie that hasn’t sold it’s soul to the CGI, and I enjoyed it.",664,2025-07-26 15:25:48,2025-07-26 15:29:05
173,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"Much of The Fantastic Four: First Steps is built around Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal) and Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) getting pregnant and having their child, Franklin. Everything seems to be built around baby proofing and preparing for someone new to enter their lives until The Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) arrives to let everyone know that an enormous cosmic being named Galactus plans to swing by and eat the entire planet. 

The superhero film feels like a sci-fi film from the 1960s, which makes sense since Fantastic Four #1 debuted in 1961. Maybe it’s the bright colors or the fact that H.E.R.B.I.E. is featured so prominently, but the first half of the film feels like a multi-episode arc of The Jetsons.

Things are lighthearted and fairly silly until The Silver Surfer shows up. But The Fantastic Four and James Gunn’s Superman seem to be honoring the silver age of comic books, which is a welcome change for superhero films.  

Oddly, the marketing makes it seem like the family bond amongst The Fantastic Four is so strong because it doesn’t seem that great while watching it. The film isn’t an origin story, as you only get a brief montage of how they got their powers. But there’s a lot of indecisiveness amongst the team with Franklin on the way. The way time passes in the film is weird. Sue’s pregnancy and Franklin’s age (apart from a certain time jump) seem accelerated, and it’s difficult to decipher if that much time has passed (nine months for the pregnancy, plus however many additional months Franklin is supposed to be) or if it’s fast-tracked because they all have powers.

The casting in The Fantastic Four: First Steps is fine, but they still seem to be finding a rhythm as a team. Reed’s brain works in a way that has him thinking of the worst scenarios, while his plans and logic stem from building everything around the most horrible solution. Sue just wants her baby to thrive in the presence of a loving family. She doesn’t want to give him to Galactus or decide his fate if he happens to have powers. She wants him to live and flourish with his own identity and choices.

The film seems to hint at Johnny being a womanizer, but he’s painfully single here. He latches onto The Silver Surfer and devotes a good chunk of the film to learning her language just so he can talk to her. The fate of the world may be at stake, sure, but dat silver ass has light years to travel and he’s got to make his moves now.

Ben is kinda boring, honestly. He shows interest in Rachel Rozman (Natasha Lyonne) and returning to the places that remind him of what it’s like to feel normal, but unless he’s destroying something or lifting a car over his head, he’s a little forgettable. He isn’t conflicted enough and doesn’t clobber enough things to leave a lasting impression.

Reed and Sue have noticeable chemistry, and they should given that they’re married. And Johnny and Ben have this macho kind of bro energy where they’re always ribbing each other and yet also sarcastically supporting one another (Ben’s beard, Johnny referring to himself in third person). As a foursome and a team, though, they still seem to be lacking, like they’re still learning to coordinate cohesively instead of Reed or Sue calling it on the spot.

The film takes place four years after the cosmic storm that caused them to gain their powers. But maybe the “first steps” part of the title refers to them still learning to work together as a team, as well as Franklin’s first baby steps.

The visual effects are mostly extremely impressive, with a few noticeable green screen shots and face animations being the only funky inclusions. The Silver Surfer’s face looks awkward at times, like it isn’t properly centered on Julia Garner’s body, or something. I wasn’t a huge fan of how the Human Torch looked either. His body is just orange with some lazy flames at the sides that don’t even cover his entire body.

The Silver Surfer chase sequences in the wormhole are some of the best the MCU has ever done. There was a bit of an uproar amongst the internet community when The Silver Surfer turned out to be female in this, but the character is given the coolest moments in the film and arguably the film’s most emotional sequence apart from the film’s finale. It's been apparent since Doctor Strange has been hinting at it in both of his films, but the MCU needs to go fully cosmic for its next phase.

Despite being beloved around the world and being a team for a decent amount of time, it feels like The Fantastic Four are still working out the kinks of being a solid team in First Steps. The performances are solid, the chemistry amongst the cast is great, and there are sentimental moments sprinkled throughout the entire film. 

There’s a lot of promise in what the future of the MCU holds with this version of The Fantastic Four, and it’s somewhat of a relief to have a Fantastic Four film that is actually worthwhile and hopefully worth revisiting with fondness instead of regret.",691,2025-07-26 22:32:41,2025-07-26 22:32:41

Because of the crap Marvel has been pumping overt the last decade, I went to watch this movie with very low hopes.

It was a surprising experience that the movie turned out to be pretty OK. Storyline is not too complicated. It is a simple predictable story without too much twisted plots or surprises. Nonetheless, the storytelling is captivating and you don’t realize how the 1:30 hr passed. Acting is pretty decent, Pedro Pascal shines in his acting. There is no typical Marvel BS in this movie.

If I had seen this movie about 15 years ago, I would have called it an average. But I am so sick and fatigued with crap movies these days, that even a normal movie like this feels good.

Overall it is worth watching.",608,2025-08-06 04:31:17,2025-08-06 04:34:29
176,87,Review from Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"There’s a distinctive charm to “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” a refreshing, visually inventive take on the MCU formula. Director Matt Shakman brings Marvel’s First Family into a retro-futuristic 1960s setting that makes the movie stand out from the typical summer superhero fare. Shakman delivers a world of bold colors, bubble-helmeted scientists, and sleek, sci-fi tech that’s unexpectedly delightful, if a bit slow moving.

Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal) and his wife Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) have their first baby on the way. They, along with Reed’s brother-in-law Johnny (Joseph Quinn) and best friend Ben (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), are excited to welcome a new bundle of joy into their home. But when a mysterious woman known as Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) shows up with a dire warning from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson), Sue and Reed are given an impossible choice: give up their newborn son to save Earth, or let the entire planet be destroyed. 

This conflict sounds compelling, but it’s also where the film stumbles. Galactus is more of a looming concept than a compelling villain, with motivations that feel too impersonal and very vague. Silver Surfer is a terrific character with an interesting back story, but the movie never quite gives her enough to do. The Four aren’t bogged down with an elaborate origin story either, and it works well here. They’re already established by the time we meet them, which allows for more time spent on character dynamics. I could see how casual audiences who are less familiar with the comic book characters could find the lack of an origin story disappointing, but the actors and their chemistry more than make up for it. 

The film leans into its “found family” theme with heart and sincerity, placing an emphasis on character over spectacle. The strong performances from the cast boost the film’s overall credibility, and the special effects are (admittedly) top notch. The themes lean heavily on the idea that family is not only biological, but also can be chosen, and there’s a nice balance between the need to be superheroes as well as parents and a strongly bonded family.

Although there is plenty to like here, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” isn’t a movie I’d ever want to revisit. I can’t honestly say that I’m excited to see any of these characters in future films, and I actually found the Four to be a little bit boring. And while it’s so nice to see a Marvel film that isn’t trying desperately to be forcefully stuffed into some extended universe timeline, the movie doesn’t entirely escape the studio’s usual pitfalls.

180,60,Review from Gimly,"**A long format review from 2012**

My new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;

1. The Avengers
2. Iron Man
3. Thor
4. Captain America
5. Iron Man 2
6. The Incredible Hulk

I had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.

I think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. 

In terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau’s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I’ve ever seen.

The only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor’s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn’t a Thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year’s Thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.

I feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.

The Avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!

181,61,Review from Per Gunnar Jonsson,"After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abysmal second instalment of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.

The special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some “depth” to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.

I’ve always liked Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the “puny god” scene (if you haven’t seen the film yet you’ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).

I have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I’m Scandinavian so…

184,37,Review from John Chard,"Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.

The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.

Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.

I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.

I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.

Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10",335,2019-08-04 12:28:04,2024-05-16 15:22:24

""Bugonia functions primarily as a stage for the memorable performances of Jesse Plemons and Emma Stone, who carry the movie with intensity and charisma.

Although Yorgos Lanthimos maintains his cohesive visual style and the tonal balance between black comedy and violence, the discursive and predictable approach to its central themes — humanity, corruption, paranoia, inequality — prevents it from achieving the complex resonance of his best films. Something didn't quite click in the narrative execution, but it remains a peculiar and entertaining experience, albeit with a short-lived thematic impact.

It leaves us with the message that, sometimes, the most fearsome monsters don't come from space, but rather from the reflection we find in the mirror.""

As a result, we might give up and disregard making any attempt to identify inherent (and potentially significant) differences. Or, by contrast, we may become so obsessed with reconciling such matters that we descend into a sea of paranoid conspiracy theories, potentially seeing them at every turn and placing us on the sidelines of reality with no credibility to our names. In actuality, the “truth” probably resides somewhere in between, but where and how do we draw the lines of accurate and meaningful distinction? Those are the considerations continually raised and examined in this new dark comedy/fable from director Yorgos Lanthimos in which a pair of intellectually challenged cousins, Teddy (Jesse Plemons) and Don (Aidan Delbis), kidnap the CEO of a major pharmaceutical company, Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone), believing that she’s an alien from Andromeda who’s quietly but determined to seek the destruction of mankind. But is their contention legitimate or the ravings of delusional madmen? The narrative continually vacillates in each direction, especially when the cousins’ captive employs some skillful psychological warfare to throw them off their game and undermine their confidence in their claim. In any event, this unlikely trio has an impending deadline of four days – the time before the alleged arrival of the Andromedan mother ship in connection with the next lunar eclipse – to resolve matters, a challenge made difficult by the emergence of several distracting subplots and the impact of Michelle’s gamesmanship on her captors’ plans. And, as the picture plays out, it raises intriguing questions about corporate motivations, unbridled greed, the sincerity (or lack thereof) behind public health initiatives, environmental degradation (particularly involving the welfare of bees and the role of colony collapse disorder (CCD)) and the true nature of Earth’s ancient past. It all makes for an intriguing mix of influences that never fails to captivate, an attribute made stronger by the fine, award-worthy performances of the three principals, a smartly penned screenplay, intriguingly clever special effects and an edgy, dramatic original score. A few pacing issues crop up at times, and several incidents of graphic violence may be more than what sensitive viewers can handle. But, those minor considerations aside, “Bugonia” is the first stellar awards season release to appear in this year’s movie marketplace and yet another brilliant work from Lanthimos, arguably one of the hottest directors in the business these days. This decidedly quirky offering probably won’t appeal to everyone, and viewers may not come away from it with any greater sense of clarity in terms of how to distinguish truth from deliberately concealed fiction. But, if nothing else, it gives us all much to think about as we attempt – no matter how successfully or futilely – to figure out what’s really going on in our world and what we might be able to do about it.",966,2025-11-01 02:04:23,2025-11-01 02:04:23
191,16,Review from misubisu,"## **Bugonia 2025 Review: A Promising Descent into Disappointment**

*Bugonia 2025* begins with immense promise, weaving a tapestry of atmospheric dread and human emotion that is utterly captivating. For its first two acts, it’s a masterclass in slow-burn suspense, anchored by a powerfully raw and believable central performance. The story of a lonely farmer’s growing, obsessive connection with a mysterious, otherworldly woman is portrayed with such grounded sincerity that you are completely drawn into its haunting, melancholic world. The cinematography is all muted tones and wide, isolating landscapes, and the score hums with a tension that feels both intimate and cosmic. In this stretch, the film flirts with greatness.

However, a film is judged by its whole, and *Bugonia 2025* suffers a catastrophic third-act collapse from which it never recovers. The pivotal moment—the revelation that the enigmatic woman is, in fact, a literal alien—is where the delicate spell is broken. Instead of leaning into the chilling, biological horror or profound existential wonder the premise suggested, the film veers sharply into the realm of the absurd.

The carefully built tension dissipates into a cloud of silliness, culminating in the disastrous reveal of the Andromedans themselves. Gone is any sense of menace or awe, replaced by antagonists that look like they stumbled out of a low-budget 1970s sci-fi pantomime, clad in inexplicably bulky, knitted one-piece outfits that inspire more laughter than fear. Their spacecraft interior, which should be the pinnacle of the film's design, feels like a cheap studio set, utterly betraying the gritty realism so painstakingly established earlier.

### The Verdict

**5 out of 10 – A Tale of Two Movies**

*Bugonia 2025* is a frustrating paradox: a film that demonstrates a profound understanding of mood and character in its first half, only to abandon that subtlety for a climax of bafflingly poor execution. The final act doesn't feel like a payoff; it feels like a betrayal of the intelligent, atmospheric story that came before it.

It’s a cinematic Jekyll and Hyde experience, leaving you with the lingering disappointment of what could have been, rather than the satisfaction of a story well told. You leave not haunted by its themes, but bewildered by its choices.

**Watch it if:** You appreciate strong acting and atmospheric building, and don't mind a film that falls apart spectacularly in its final act.
**Skip it if:** You require a coherent and satisfying payoff to your sci-fi mysteries. The journey, while initially compelling, ultimately leads to a dead end of disbelief.",975,2025-11-07 06:48:19,2025-11-07 06:48:19
192,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Convinced that the Andromedans are bent on taking over the Earth, cousins “Teddy” (Jesse Plemons) and “Don” (Aidan Delbis) hit upon a plan to force their emperor to discuss the terms by which he will withdraw his fifth-column forces from the world. That involves some anaesthetic, two pairs of stockings and the kidnapping of “Michelle” (Emma Stone). She is the successful chief executive of a blue chip tech company and is, they are convinced, an high ranking official in the enemy government. Actually getting hold of her doesn’t prove so much of a problem, but as they begin their very civilised interrogation it soon becomes quite clear that these two have - what might kindly be referred to as - a screw loose. She is confident that before long the authorities will spot she is missing and launch a full scale search; “Teddy” is equally satisfied that they can keep her under wraps until she reveals the secrets of their communication strategy. She tries a few different tacks to obtain her freedom, but is she ever going to be able to convince them one way or the other to set her free? Aside from taking a fairly joyous pop at some early sci-fi plots, this also sees Yorgos Lanthimos take a swipe at corporate greed and it’s work ethics and with Plemons on top form as the diplomatically minded cousin and Delbis as entertaining as his slightly slower on the uptake relative, the scene is set for an amiable series of scenarios that offer us a none-too-subtle series of parodies of so much of what modern day life thinks is real, important and/or plain shallow. Stone really does enter into the spirit of things and like Plemons, actually looks like she is enjoying the experience - even if at times it looked pretty painful. I did rather enjoy the last ten minutes, and I reckon this is well worth a cinema outing if you like your humour a little more cerebral and you don’t have an inter-stellar communicator in your pocket.

194,96,Review from Kamurai,"Really good watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend, but less so for younger audiences.

I never remembered all the weird adult humor in this, it is usually just the charming grinchiness of Jim Carey's overacting that sticks with me, and maybe the Christmas spirit of Mary Lou Who.

The movie manages to ride this wonderfully line between keeping the spirit of the book (even rhyming at times) and being new and refreshing, but it does do that by playing to the adults that would have read the book as a child rather than endearing a new generation of children, but I think they intended to try to do both.

Jim Carey embodies the Grinch like no one else possibly could (I think Mike Myers proved that in ""The Cat in the Hat""), and that is the majority of this so if you don't enjoy him, then you won't enjoy this movie.  I do think they added some refreshing character interactions, though some of the execution is much better than others.

While it is far from a perfect movie, my biggest gripe is their stupid noses: it seriously bothers me the entire movie.  It bothers me more than them dressing the Grinch, which points out that he is naked a LOT with his ""co lead"" being a young girl: you can see it just distracts from the spirit of the movie.

I don't think that everyone is going to love this movie, but it's hard to imagine that people will hate it.",116,2020-07-27 15:24:25,2021-06-23 15:58:41

199,99,Review from Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A movie about Christmas, and about the way we face it.**

For starters, I must clarify that I have never seen any other material about Grinch, much less the original book where this character was created. I will judge this movie for what it is, without weaves comparisons. He is not my Christmas favorite, never was, I even think it is a little scary for smaller children, given the mischiefs and attitude of Grinch. But it has a good story, good dialogues and other qualities.

What is Christmas? Many will say that's the family or children's party. I accept, but in fact, it is the symbolic date that the Catholic Church marks the birth of Jesus. No one knows when Jesus was born, but the Church chose the date for convenience, coinciding the feast with an older pagan celebration, Saturnalia. For centuries, Christmas was just a festive day when Catholics confessed themselves, listened to Mass and ate fish (the consumption of meat and candy is forbidden on holy days, even though the elites did, by paying cash indulgences... in my country it's still tradition to eat codfish in Christmas Eve). The ""invention"" of modern Christmas happened in the late nineteenth century, with capitalism, and the creation of toy industries and food industries that allowed the middle classes a more interesting supper and the gift for children, offered to them by Baby Jesus and, later, for the invented character of Father Natal (in Spain, this exchange of gifts is only made on the day of kings in January, what I think makes full sense). This is how, in England, Germany and the US, Christmas became more commercial, more focused on consuming, gift distribution and conviviality, and the religious aspect was putted in the background.

This movie, released in the 1980s, shows us an evil character who learned to see Christmas as futile due to this obsession with toys, gifts and food. He does not know how to express this in the best way, he's unaware that behind this is a greater meaning, but what Grinch rejects is precisely this ""commercial Christmas."" And I couldn't agree more with him… So, through his mischiefs, Grinch will help people to rediscover the meaning of Christmas, even if this is not his real purpose. This is the beauty of this story, for me: Grinch will help the Whoos while they will help him to understand that Christmas is more than gifts or food.

Directed by Ron Howard, a director whose credits do not require presentations, the film is very well done and was a gigantic box office hit and critical success. It became a Christmas classic, although today it is not so popular. With no dead moments, it has an excellent pace, it does not lengthen too much, it is not tiring, and the script does what it needs, although with various flaws and several jokes that are not working. I liked, in particular, the narrator's interventions and rhymes, something that reinforces the idea that this is a children's story. Cinematography is amazing, with vibrant and flashy colors, and the soundtrack, not being memorable, has good qualities.

Jim Carrey did very well in accepting the difficult task of bringing Grinch to life. I can only imagine how boring it was for him to be subject to that make-up routine every day, but it was totally worth the time and sacrifice: he's unrecognizable and absolutely credible and authentic under that thing, and has a natural gift to model the voice as he wants and suits to the character. Sir Anthony Hopkins also deserves praise for his participation, having lent his voice to the narrator. The rest does a positive job, but merely supports Carrey in its task of building the movie around it.",172,2024-06-10 09:02:22,2024-06-10 09:02:22
200,5,Review from MovieGuys,"""Altered"" isn't your typical sci fi action thriller. 

The idea of a less than heroic protagonist, taking on a dystopian eugenics based state, is a little different. The concept ""sort of"" works but would have been  better with a more focused script, combined with some extra polish, particularity in the rather clumsy, action scenes.

That said, the main character and his adopted daughter, are inherently likeable, the back story is at least somewhat original and the dystopian setting is well crafted.

In summary, ""Altered"" is different in a largely positive way. Its just a shame more time and money, wasn't expended, giving this film the improvements it needs. Nonetheless, still worth a look.",313,2025-11-22 23:58:30,2025-11-23 19:35:51

I have to say these elements combined with a dash of nostalgia from the 80's works, quite well. Sure its not A grade horror but its still creative, creepy and above all, entertaining. 

In summary, a not unfamiliar but still well crafted tale of revenge from beyond the grave. Worth a look.",117,2025-10-19 07:09:45,2025-10-19 20:42:10
202,18,Review from MontyTG,"**One of the best horror sequels that will go down as an instant classic in a couple of years**

I already feel like this film doesn't get enough praise for blending multiple horror franchises together, but still delivering something brand new that fits in the same world as the original film. It takes the classic camp setting but sets it in a blizzard (Friday The 13th meets The Shining). It explores dreams, the spiritual realm and the afterlife (A Nightmare On Elm Street meets Insidious meets Poltergeist). The story and tone are also much more in line with modern storytelling (Terrifier meets Hereditary). The soundtrack is also incredibly retro with a hint of child-like wonder. (Sinister meets Five Nights At Freddy's). I generally cannot express how well it all blends together to deliver a realistic portrayal of a spirit that escaped from hell. If you think The Grabber is just a Freddy Krueger rip-off, then you completely missed the point of the film.",347,2025-10-23 11:12:42,2025-11-08 23:39:54
203,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"This is quite a decent icy thriller, but is hasn’t anywhere near the claustrophobic intensity of the first film from 2021. It is still Mason Thames who portrays the now seventeen year old “Finn”, convinced that he seen the last of the “Grabber” but still having nightmares about a phone ringing. To add to his sleeplessness, his sister “Gwen” (also still Madeleine McGraw) is having some fairly torturous nightmares that, coupled with some sleep-walking, are unsettling both of them. Determined to find out what is causing these traumas, they hook up with her fellow Duran Duran fan “Ernesto” (Miguel Mora) and head to the very Christian fellowship camp where their mum was a counsellor. They arrive just as the mother of all blizzards sets in, and so up to their elbows in snow and ice they have to piece together just what happened to half a dozen children reported killed at the place but never found, and establish whether or not the dastardly “Grabber” is still something to be reckoned with. The cold and frosty environment and half decent efforts from Thames and McGraw do help to keep this mystery rolling along, but despite some curious and menacing flashbacks that fill us in with what did and might happen, the story here just isn’t very solid or original. It takes far too long to get going, and the denouement - though quite action-packed, is all just too rushed and disappointing. I did quite like the barbed remarks aimed at the god-fearing/adoring “Barb” (Maev Beaty) and it’s all perfectly watchable, but it could easily lose twenty minutes to condense the plot and get us to the snowy sharp-end a bit more swiftly. Worth a watch, but not as good.",510,2025-11-06 18:29:22,2025-11-06 18:33:14

The writing felt a bit all over the place but most of the jokes were on point, the action was very enjoyable, and I think giving Superman a more classic comic feel and less of the apocalyptic Snyder vibe was a good change.

Everyone here does a great job with the acting. Lois and Jimmy are, in my opinion, the standouts. Nicholas Hoult wasn't a great choice for Luthor, with his more manic energy. Personally, I enjoyed Hackman or Cryer's cold, cunning version more. 

And, y'all, Krypto is in it. Finally we got a dog!

TLDR: It's good but not great. With that said, I still think you'll have a great time watching it. Also, DEFINITELY SEE IT IN 3D.



***SPOILERS BELOW***

I have two complaints. 

They give us two of Superman's coolest villains: Lex Luthor and Bizarro, but lame versions of both. I was expecting something on par with Iron Man vs Ironmonger circa 2008, but Lex never dons his suit. I was pretty sure the masked villain was Bizarro, and later he's revealed to be, but it would have been so much better if the authentic version had been written in.",33,2025-07-12 15:18:32,2025-07-13 15:31:45
208,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/superman-review-james-gunn-gives-the-man-of-steel-a-soul/

""Superman isn't perfect. It struggles with pacing, has too many characters, and offers some clunky narrative solutions. But as the official cinematic introduction to the new DCU, it succeeds where it matters most: establishing the central pillars of the saga, giving us a worthy protagonist, and showcasing a filmmaker with a clear vision.

David Corenswet is the Superman this generation needs: a symbol of kindness, hope, and - above all - conviction-led action. Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult round out a high-quality central trio, and even with its flaws, it's hard not to leave the theater satisfied.

James Gunn delivers a clear statement of intent: DC's future is in good hands. Bring on the rest of Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. If this is the path forward, maybe - finally - DC can fly as high as its greatest hero.""

209,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"Considerable chatter has been devoted in recent years to the question of whether the movie industry is producing too many superhero/action-adventure films. Much of that talk has specifically focused on whether certain franchises/mythologies have been overdone. That’s particularly true where the “Superman” mythos is concerned, a body of work that has assumed multiple forms on TV and the big screen since the 1970s. And, after viewing this latest iteration involving this storied and much beloved character, I can’t help but concur with the opinion that the man from the planet Krypton needs to be given a serious rest for a while. In my opinion, what has been called the biggest disappointment of this summer’s blockbuster season is an assessment that’s, unfortunately, right on target. In short, writer-director James Gunn’s latest is a hot mess that strains viewer interest not long into its overlong 2:09:00 runtime (a duration that honestly feels even longer than the official tally) and never manages to get it back. The biggest problem here rests with an overstuffed narrative that at times becomes challenging to follow, thanks to a screenplay that’s loaded with incongruities, rampant assumptions and a noticeable lack of back story; film editing tediously in need of much-needed snipping; overreliance on comic relief that grows progressively tiresome (especially with Superman’s annoyingly overzealous canine pal, Krypto); and an overall production whose vision is both tedious and not particularly original (especially in the rather ho-hum action sequences that we’ve seen so many, many times before in better films, most notably those from the Marvel Universe). In addition, the picture’s attempts at updating the nature of the Superman mythology for the present day are uneven at best, including some elements that are sufficiently contemporary with others that are woefully anachronistic (e.g., why are elements involving The Daily Planet newspaper portrayed in much the same way as they were in the past, given that today’s journalism business is a very different animal from what it was years ago?). To its credit, the film’s attempts at evolving the protagonist’s character into a paragon of “wokeness” (a source of much criticism in some circles) provides an intriguing spin on the nature of the Man of Steel – one very much in line with Superman’s traditional embodiment as a champion of “truth, justice and the American way” – even if it is somewhat excessive on occasion. That’s especially true where matters involving “aliens” (like Kal El himself) are symbolically demonized as threats to society, a less-than-subtle allusion to how many perceive today’s immigrants. However, the attempt at making the film’s hero more socially relevant is at times undermined by inconsistent character development, a problem that plagues many of this release’s other players, too. And that’s unfortunate in light of the performances on display, including a capable Christopher Reeve-esque portrayal by the film’s lead (David Corenswet), as well as fine supporting characterizations of mythology staples Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult). In essence, though, “Superman” regrettably feels like an offering created by committee, a production that desperately should have gone through several more rounds of revisions before being committed to a final print. What’s more, if this picture was meant to lead off a new franchise involving this character, it comes up short all around, a prospect that doesn’t bode particularly well for the artistic future of this series. Superman deserves better than this, but that’s noticeably lacking in this release, one that, over time, is likely to become forgettable, particularly when measured against its superior predecessors, films that commendably and authentically depict its protagonist as a genuinely super-man.",615,2025-07-13 01:36:45,2025-07-13 14:59:29
210,101,Review from CrazyJekyll,"First of all i would like to say that this isnt a bad movie by any means. In fact there's actually a lot to enjoy here and is easily the BEST live-action Superman movie since the Christopher Reeve era.

Corenswet as Superman/Clark is fucking amazing and the characterization of Supes would've been perfect if it weren't for that one plot twist (more on that later). I also like that thay made a point but its more on his ACTIONS that define who you are. Hoult is also spectacular, you can just feel his hate and anger and those nasty little evil smirks everytime he wins against our boy in blue. Rachel Brosnahan is also fucking perfect as Lois Lane and her interactions with not only Clark but also the Justice Gang is pure comic Lois. And to top it all of, the action, score, and visual imagery are all very much comic book-esque and just straight up fucking beautiful to see. (Mr Terrific and Metamorpho are both so good and entertaining).

BUT there is one big twist here that 90% of the general audience won't care about, but as a comic fan the twist just brings this movie down from like a 8-9/10 to a 6-7/10. That twist is just that BAD atleast for someone like me who is a big big Superman comic fan.

SPOILERS FROM NOW ON:

Now for the big plot twist. Making the House of El (Jor El and Lara) evil and Superman believing himself to be more human than alien was a really really bad choice. As i mentioned before, i know that the whole point is that Kal or Superman or Clark is more defined by his ACTIONS rather than his heritage. But to make them completely evil and have clark reject his heritage at the end (completely replacing his krypton parents with footage from his earth parents) just really sucks.

FIRST OF ALL the decision to make them evil just ruins the immigrant allegory. If you've read the comics you would know that Clark is a deeply lonely guy. Having to grow up knowing you're an alien, is different from everyone else and would constantly need to hide his powers and true self. He is afraid of being REJECTED and is the reason why he constantly yearns for his home planet krypton, a place where he could actually feel like himself and not some outsider. So to make his whole origin planet evil?? is not really helping the immigrant allegory. Like imagine if your an immigrant to the USA and suddenly in the news everyone says that your home country and everyone from there is fucking evil. STRAIGHT UP XENOPHOBIA. And to say that Clark wouldn't care about his parents and origin planet because he didnt know them is stupid. I think that Learning your father was a man who tried but failed to save a world that wouldn't listen to him would definitely have an impact on a guy who's trying to save the world everyday.

A comic issue that showcased his loneliness and fear of rejection from humans is ACTION COMICS #794 where we see Clark in his adolescence watching a film with his friends, wherein the aliens are the villains and everyone around him js cheering for the aliens to go back to their planets. Imagine the pain and loneliness you would feel knowing that everyone around you even your friends just want you to go the fuck away.

Also this is exactly why his origin needs to be truly adapted because thats where his character, morality, and such really shine. It's not only where his identity crisis and loneliness are explicitly explored but also where we see that it is not only his actions that define him but also the synthesis of all his experiences juggling his alien and human side. It also adds layers to his eventual rivalry with Lex, and shows his relationship with other super powered beings like the Legion.

In relation to that, this is also why SUPERBOY is important to be shown/adapated because its with his heroics as a teen that led to him meeting other heroes mainly the Legion of Superheroes. His adventures with the Legion is where he truly finds who he is, because like him they're also teens going through the same problems. With the legion he finally got a community where he doesn't have to hide anything, can share his problems that no other human can get and most importantly feel less LONELY and feel VALIDATED knowing that a future where superpowered beings are accepted actually exist.

(Also quick side note, this is also why him dating and losing his virginity to mermaid Lori Lemaris is so important to me. Sex and Intimacy is often done with someone you can be vulnerable with, and a mermaid or another kryptonian Lyra Lerrol be his first time is just so fitting. ADAPT SUPERBOY AND LORI PLEASE)

Him yearning for his kryptonian heritage also doesnt make him less human. Because why else would he still choose and create his secret identity/persona Clark Kent if he wants to reject it. Clark is his own guilty little pleasure of living as a human because even if he is an alien it shows that he still enjoys earth and cherishes humanity and its culture. He is supposed to be the BEST of both worlds and having him be one sided makes him a FAR LESS interesting character.

Again im going to reiterate this making him more human just removes too much LAYERS.

Another reason why his origin needs to be adapted is his relationship with Lex Luthor. In Smallville and other iconic comics such as Birthright, Secret Origin, and most recently Last Days of Lex. In these stories a young clark is often shown to have a brief childhood friendship with Lex. Like Clark, Lex always felt alone as a child. He was a science nut and was always interested in the larger universe of extra terrestrials and the like. People constantly saw and bullied him as a weird freak, and everytime he tried to help others people would just reject him. Clark was the only one who tolerated and protected him leading to their ""friendship""
But Lex's obsession with the larger universe led to his failed experiment and eventual downfall. He tried to create a machine to find and/or communicate with extra terrestrial life but it exploded and almost killed a ton of people. This led to further rejection from the people of Smallville and made him think that people would always see him as a freak just because he thought bigger and wanted to create science for a better tomorrow. This rejection then of course made him angry, resentful, and didnt care who he stepped on as long as he got his way.

And Clark feels guilty, because if Clark just told him who he really was then maybe Lex wouldn't have turned out evil. If Lex just had a friend who not only matched his intellect but also understood his experiences of being outcasted and then maybe, just maybe both of them together could have used their powers to save and create a better tomorrow for everyone. With this context in mind the rivalry becomes more complex. Superman isnt trying to just stop Lex simply because he's evil. He's also just trying to save his friend.

There are a lot more things that i dont like in the film but this where my main points really stop. My other complaints like Jimmy not being a weird lovable dork enough (he's just too regular) and most of the Daily Planet just being caricatures of their comic selves and Clark just having one scene are all really minor nitpicks that can be solved with future movies and adventures.

But again as i said in the beginning despite all my long ass complaints there's still a lot to enjoy in this film. And i cannot deny that there is clearly heart in here and is easily still the best Supes movie since Christopher Reeve. It's just the Evil Els that really ruined it for me.

LASTLY Kara having a cameo at the end kinda breaks the movie in half. Like bro, if you really think the El's are evil then why do you still like your cousin? why do you still wear the House of El logo? like bro your cousin is a living example of the footage being straight up wrong lol.

Look, it may look like im a hater right now but i genuinely just wanted to love this movie. There are so much scenes here that made the comic book fan in me just smile and cheer like crazy. But the flaws were just way too big for me and it really muddled my experience. I just want Superman, my favorite comic character of all time to be adapted well. And yes while this is definitely the best Adaptation since 1978, it just didn't hit for me. If you're a comic fan or just a movie fan in general im sure you'll still find enjoyment in this because the whole movie is still very fuckin endearing and action packed. But yeah for now, im sticking to the comics. Peace.",537,2025-07-15 13:45:24,2025-07-15 13:45:24
211,13,Review from r96sk,"<em>'Superman'</em> is the best Supes film that I've seen - and I highly enjoyed 2013's <em>'Man of Steel'</em>, so that is actually saying something. I was surprised at how great this 2025 edition is, like at no point was I ever doubting what I was seeing - it's a fab 2hrs.

I had seen snippets from a few trailers for this and, in truth, wasn't really vibing with it back then. The lead actor seemed a bit underwhelming, the dialogue felt lousy and Lex Luthor came across over the top. I'm pleased to say, none of those things are true.

David Corenswet is an ace Superman, he fits the role to perfection. Again, I did like Henry Cavill's stint as the eponymous Kryptonian, though I do reckon Corenswet does ever so slightly outdo him. It's silly of me to even compare to be honest, given my appreciation for both.

For me, Nicholas Hoult is just as big a plus. This is the best of him I've seen, given I've never been fully convinced. Don't get me wrong, I've liked performances from him, but almost always with an asterisk of sorts attached in my mind. No such issues here, he is fantastic as Lex.

Rachel Brosnahan and Edi Gathegi also dazzle, the latter's character is especially interesting as I never knew he existed before this - hope to see more! Anthony Carrigan, Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced also manage to stick out, which is impressive. All those onsceen are good.

The story is a surpremely entertaining one. I like how they skipped over the origins of Superman, the vast majority of viewers already know the backstory so it's not needed - and for those that don't, a simple short overview, as seen here, is more than enough to get the point across.

As for everthing else? The pacing, the visuals, the special effects, the music... all excellent. I, somewhat unexpectedly, have zero issues with this one, I thoroughly had fun with it and would happily revisit it at any time.",161,2025-07-18 19:40:29,2025-07-18 19:40:29
212,5,Review from MovieGuys,"Putting all else aside, James Gunn's ""Superman"" succeed's because it adopts a comfortably familiar, wholly ""likeable"", approach.

This film borrows heavily from the 70's Superman franchise. Its look, its feel, right down to costumes, harks back to that era. As does, the very simple, down to earth main character, capably played by  David Corenswet. I personally, could not but recall Christoper Reeve, in his performance.

This is Superman as he was mean't to be. No cynicism, no divisive woke politics, just a good guy doing his best. Its this innately appealing character and those around him, that make this film function. Because lets be honest, whilst its an entertaining romp, the script is, in my estimation ""chaotic"". Its literally all over the place, doing too many things at once. That said, if you view those scenes in isolation, a good portion, are both enjoyable and amusing. For example, Lex Luthor, getting his comeuppance, from Superman's cousins, kooky Superdog. 

In summary, no ""Superman"" 2025 is not a perfect film. That said, in a world that's become cynical and divisive, the simple, honest, likeability of this film shines though in a way that's impossible to ignore. For my money, well worth a look.",643,2025-07-21 21:28:54,2025-08-31 23:27:09
213,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"I know I’m swimming against the tide here, but I just didn’t really rate this. I suppose it was only a matter of time before “Superman” got dragged (literally) into the multiverse. This time it is the DC one that’s being used by the evil “Lex Luthor” (Nicholas Hoult) who has quite a grudge against our red-caped hero. That’s because “Soop” (David Corensweet) recently intervened in a war to assist a small agrarian nation from being invaded by it’s nasty militarised neighbour. With access to his enormous resources, “Luthor” manages to penetrate the secret Antarctic fortress of our well-meaning protector to find not only his deepest secrets but also to kidnap his energetic dog “Krypto” - thus luring his quarry into the aforementioned “pocket universe” where the ultimate super-max prison contains many whom the planet doesn’t know what do do with any more, and a few ex-girlfriends. What chance he can escape through a complex sequence of portals (think “Stargate”)? Well that is largely down to his tenacious on/off girlfriend “Lois” (Rachel Brosnahan) who is entirely aware of her beau’s double identity, and to a tech whizz (Edi Gathegi) from another group of meta humans called the “Justice Gang” run by the “Green Lantern” who occasionally help out when the relentless stream of aliens descend on Metropolis. Now the scene is set for a really weak, repetitious and entirely derivative series of thwack and pow adventures that had me looking at the ceiling just once too often. Gene Hackman was always going to take some beating as “Luthor” but why use a British actor at all, and then make him use an entirely unnecessary American accent before giving him lines that make him sound like a frenzied bingo-caller? What’s with the dog? Aw, bless, but really? It just goes to show how remarkably ordinary “Superman” has become in a world so completely dominated by technology and people with far greater superpowers. Corensweet tries quite hard, is easy on the eye and he has some charm to him, but nobody else really has enough to get their teeth into and just by shaving Hoult’s head you don’t make him menacing. He isn’t in the least. There is cheesy sentiment all over this CGI-fest of a film that has a passing similarity to Ezra Miller’s “The Flash” from 2023. Sure, it moves along quickly but when you start to create cracks in what made a superhero super in the first place, you have to be able to infill with some serious attempts at action characterisation - not slushy dog-loving, baby/girlfriend-saving ones. No such development happens here and after the final denouement - there are a few goes at that - I left the cinema thinking this was an huge victory for style over substance and that this fella isn’t so much super as flawed: physically and emotionally. That wasn’t what I wanted to see. It’s a family film that can offend no-one and that looks great on a big screen, but I was distinctly disappointed, sorry.",358,2025-07-23 12:03:32,2025-07-23 12:14:11
214,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"The version of Superman in James Gunn’s film differs from past film iterations of the character. In other films, Superman is a one-man powerhouse. He is the only one who can save the day, and there is no plan B if he happens to lose. Maybe other heroes exist in that cinematic universe, but a major team doesn’t come together until a later film, and those other heroes are busy keeping people safe in their neck of the woods.

In the 2025 version of Superman, the film begins with Superman losing for the first time. The story Gunn wants to tell is how Kal-El faces the challenge of not only losing, but continuing to lose nearly everything that he holds dear. Superman gets his ass kicked throughout the film and barely scrapes by in fights.

Superman reintroduces color to superhero films after what felt like an eternity of a more serious comic book movie era, where everything tried to be serious and washed out in color. Superman feels like opening an old issue of Action Comics or a Superman comic from the 90s. Colors are bright and radiant to an extent that feels almost cartoonish, like a comic book.

Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) has a plan that results in the entire world turning on Superman and Luthor being in control of the United States when it comes to interacting with metahumans (humans with superpowers) and whether they pose a threat or not. Superman disappears after being taken captive, and it’s up to Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi) to save him.

I’ve never been a huge fan of Superman. The original 1978 film, Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, and Superman: The Animated Series from the late 90s are the highlights of the character for me. In Gunn’s film, David Corenswet doesn’t specifically add anything new to the character that we haven’t seen before. That’s not ragging on Corenswet’s performance, but it seems to be how the Superman character is.

He is a god among men, and the thing that makes him special is that he not only cares about the human race, but also views himself as human, because despite being an alien, he also makes mistakes. Corenswet delivers that bold sense of hope Superman is known for and is the embodiment of the modern version of the character.

It feels like Gunn knew that Superman’s straightforward demeanor couldn’t carry the film, and that’s one of the reasons why he surrounded him with so many supporting characters. Gunn has made a career of giving the spotlight to losers, outcasts, and characters who never should work together but are either forced to or feel like the family they’ve never been able to have once they’re all together.

Lex Luthor has a short fuse in this film, but that fuse turned to ash eons ago. He is seething with his hatred for Superman. He is envious of Superman’s popularity, but also hates the fact that he isn’t from this planet. Nicholas Hoult goes completely unhinged in his performance, but the scary aspect is that the average person can either see red and let themselves give in to rage or think logically and sensibly while thinking about what comes next. Lex not only does both of those things in Superman, but he is almost always two or three steps ahead of everyone else in the film.

Ultraman and The Engineer (Maria Gabriela de Faria) work for Lex Luthor and do all of the heavy lifting and fighting for Lex. The Engineer has a suit made from nanotechnology, while drones operated by drones control Ultraman to do Lex’s bidding. The Justice Gang – consisting of Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Mister Terrific, and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) – handles heroic matters when Superman has his hands full. Guy is this universe’s version of Green Lantern, Mister Terrific is an inventor who uses his high-tech gadgets to fight crime, and Hawkgirl can fly and swing heavy weapons or something.

The film devotes a huge portion of its story to Ultraman, while The Engineer and Hawkgirl are strong female characters without much to do. The inclusion of The Engineer is said to be building towards a film centered around The Authority, but Hawkgirl is kind of forgettable as a character. She has a memorable scene near the end of the film, but the character as a whole isn’t developed at all.

For a James Gunn film, the humor is toned way down in comparison to his other films. Nathan Fillion’s Guy Gardner embodies Gunn’s typical comedy with a charming sense of juvenile obnoxiousness that you can’t help but love. Gunn’s other films, specifically the Guardians of the Galaxy films and the Suicide Squad, were fueled by constant bickering. There’s a sequence where Lois interviews Clark as Superman that feels like it’s attempting to add weight to Gunn’s fascination with comedic arguing and succeeds for the most part.

Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) is one of the more unique characters with some of the most visually impressive sequences in the film, and Krypto is a national treasure. It’s wild that Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) is the biggest player of Metropolis, as every woman wants a piece of that.

James Gunn’s Superman rips the hope away from Superman and focuses on the real possibility of him not being able to save the day or even be the hero that people want to save them. Superman can eventually overcome impossible odds, but it’s earned, and nearly every supporting character is given the chance to contribute.

Superman is goofy, hopeless, and rewarding in all of the best ways. Some characters aren’t given as much time as others, but it feels like James Gunn is attempting to build a DC Universe full of interesting characters that are not only worthy of being on screen but deserve to be there.",725,2025-07-26 12:48:39,2025-07-26 12:48:39

217,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Though not quite as much fun as the original, this isn't an half bad follow-up. The beginning is a little too convoluted setting the scene as this time the family go to Florida but a last minute mix-up at the airport sends ""Kevin"" (Macauley Culkin) to New York. Initially a bit apprehensive, he heads - armed with his dad's credit card - straight to the Plaza Hotel where he goes a bit bonkers with the room service and catches the attention of suspicious concierge Tim Curry. Whilst out exploring, the recently released Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern bump into him and decide to exact their revenge - not before telling him of their daring plan to rob a toy store. Of course he escapes their clutches, and quickly decides to try to thwart their thievery - as only he can. Curry is on good form here, as is just about everyone else as the slapstick hits overdrive and the paint pots, a nail gun and even an old cannon find innovative new uses. It is a good team effort, this - with plenty of gentle humour and amusing antics. Maybe just a bit too long, the joke starts to wear a bit thin but Chris Columbus has built well on the first film, with just enough variation from that one whilst essentially keeping the story the same.",139,2023-08-26 08:02:17,2023-08-26 08:02:17
218,57,Review from Reno,"Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.

As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.

It all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.

As I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.

The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.

There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.

‘‘This world's a treasure,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’

All the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.

Remember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.

Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.

I could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.

‘‘Maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory.’’

The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.

The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.

It will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",307,2014-11-12 16:06:04,2024-05-16 15:18:26
219,102,Review from decovision,"People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. 
Interstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.
I remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. 
Since then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.
I read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.
If you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.",826,2015-09-12 14:49:33,2021-06-23 15:57:37
220,56,Review from Andres Gomez,"Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.

The cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...

* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.
* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.
* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.

All in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan.",284,2015-10-31 12:07:03,2021-06-23 15:57:38
221,103,Review from Asadullah Khan,"""Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.""

IT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.

This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.

The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.

Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.

Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.

The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.

Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.

With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.

222,104,Review from shaunfrombklyn,"This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. 

The story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.

But what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. 

My only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.

223,61,Review from Per Gunnar Jonsson,"That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.

Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.

The movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.

The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!

The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.

The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?

The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.",457,2017-12-21 17:11:31,2024-05-16 15:21:16

---
Interstellar is my favorite movie. I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. 
The soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!
The movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it. I watched the movie 7 times and I still enjoy it!",335,2020-01-20 18:22:37,2021-06-23 15:58:33
226,84,Review from Matthew Brady,"""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light"".

The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.

Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called ""Interstellar"" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.

I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.

The visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.

Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.

My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.

Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.",925,2020-01-27 18:22:32,2021-06-23 15:58:33
227,107,Review from Peter McGinn,"I will not add another in depth review to the several I see here on this movie. Nor will I try to evaluate the accuracy of the science behind the plot. Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.

But I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn’t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.

So the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.

Oh, and I say it is entertainment rather than a documentary, but it is not light entertainment. If you want to give this movie a fair chance, give it your full attention. It is not Mars Attacks, where you can watch it while distracted by life and still pick up on  plot details.",378,2021-11-02 07:34:59,2021-11-02 07:34:59

The plot recycles old beats—corporate greed, a betrayal, someone shouting “Run!”—while new characters feel like action figures with catchphrases. A few set pieces land, and it’s refreshing to see a Hispanic family in the lead, even if they feel a bit gimmicky. It’s not bad, just safe. If you want thrills, it delivers.

""Jurassic World Rebirth ends up reflecting the franchise's current state. A visually competent product, with talent in front of and behind the camera, but lost in its lack of purpose and narrative ambition.

The cast is excellent, but the characters are hollow. The dinosaurs are still impressive, but their presence no longer holds the same weight. And the themes - once so rich and provocative - have been replaced by modern dilemmas that, while valid, don't truly belong in this universe.

Maybe it's time to accept that life does, indeed, find a way - but that way isn't always through continuation. Sometimes, the best thing we can do… is let go.""

230,5,Review from MovieGuys,"""Jurassic World Rebirth"" proves, yet again, how fossilised this franchise has become.

The ossification of fresh ideas is glaring, with a tedious, formulaic story, a lack of narrative depth and equally shallow characterisations.Expositions competently done but in isolation, that's not saying much. 

In short, this is a superficially polished but nonetheless lazy effort, that adds nothing of value to a creatively exhausted franchise. 

In summary, an unoriginal, uninspiring, generally a lazy effort, that moves this franchise ever closer, to cinematic extinction.",654,2025-07-04 04:19:41,2025-07-15 07:57:18

232,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"Sometimes movies have a way of surprising us in unexpectedly pleasant ways. And this latest installment in the “Jurassic” franchise is just such a case. Admittedly, I had more than a few reservations going into this one; I couldn’t help but think that this was a cinematic commodity that had run its course, that it was essentially out of gas to offer anything new of genuine value, and, to a certain degree, that’s true, at least where originality is concerned. However, despite the picture’s expected plunge into familiar territory, director Gareth Edwards’s latest feature offering is nevertheless highly entertaining, even if not particularly groundbreaking. Perhaps that rests with the fact that this is arguably the most Spielbergian installment in the series, in many ways reflective of the iconic production that launched the franchise in 1993. In yet another story involving self-serving agenda-driven characters placing themselves in tremendous peril by venturing into a world of dangerous, genetically manipulated dinosaurs recklessly brought back to life for profit and entertainment purposes, the film follows a narrative formula that most viewers will find more than a little recognizable. But what helps to set this installment apart from many of its predecessors is the quality of the filmmaking itself, specifically its ability to effectively build and maintain tension, its capacity for presenting story arc elements in fresh and inventive ways, and its overall production values, most notably its fine (and occasionally unanticipated) special effects and its efforts in upping the talent quotient of the cast with such commendable additions as Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali. Most importantly, though, this offering is to be applauded for its continuity in staying on track in terms of tone, self-aware of what kind of a movie it truly wants to be. This differentiates “Rebirth” from many of its previous releases, which often couldn’t decide whether they wanted to tell bona fide sci-fi-based tales or present themselves as campy romps (as seen, for example, in the now-famous (or is it infamous?) Bryce Dallas Howard high heel sequences in the first “Jurassic World” offering (2015)). What’s more, Spielberg’s influence in bringing this production to life is clearly present in the finished product, both in terms of honoring the merits of the series’ premiere installment, as well as in its respectful homages to the auteur’s classic 1975 offering, “Jaws.” To be sure, there are some aspects here that are wholly predictable (such as little doubt as to which characters will be offed and when), and there are times when the pacing could stand to be brisker, particularly when the film strives (sometimes a little too hard) to invoke a greater degree of character depth and development than what has typically been the case in previous “Jurassic” releases. In addition, the picture suffers from occasional plot holes, several contrived narrative devices (including one egregiously silly element near the film’s outset that nearly cost me my hopes for the remainder of the release) and more than a little blatantly shameless product placement shots. On balance, though, this is a surprisingly good picture in a series that’s now seven installments deep, an accomplishment that few franchises (other than the “Star Trek” and “007” series) can boast. Don’t be too quick to sell this one short; it may not be perfect, but it’s certainly enjoyable summertime action-adventure fare that makes for a good time on a lazy Saturday afternoon when you don’t feel like going outside to brave the heat.",819,2025-07-06 01:53:58,2025-07-06 15:02:29
233,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Well at least there is one scene where huge great dinosaurs walk, accompanied by John Williams’s original theme, to remember - but otherwise this is a really disappointing video-game of a film that offers us nothing at all that the Jurassic franchise hasn’t already. By now, these great creatures have largely been taken care of by Mother Nature and have been reduced to living in small groups in equatorial zones around the world where they just want to be left alone to eat and be eaten, protected from a humanity which is “expressly” prohibited from going there. The grasping “Krebs” (Rupert Friend - Orlando Bloom must have been busy) has a plan to cure heart disease and so recruits special ops veteran “Zora” (Scarlett Johansson) to help him secure the living DNA from three of the greatest of these creatures. They wouldn’t know one if they saw one though, so have to convince the nerdy scientist “Loomis” (Jonathan Bailey) to accompany them and their local fixer “Kincaid” (Mahershala Ali) and they head deep into these deadly waters. Meantime, a family are blithely sailing from Bermuda to Cape Town, apparently unaware of the dangers posed by these Vernian monsters. They are dad, young daughter, hormonal older daughter and her bone idle boyfriend, “Xavier” (David Iacono). Boy are they in for a shock when they cross some huge great, and angry, Mosasaurus and end up with most of their boat pointing the wrong way in the water, but with “Xavier” still able to catch some rays whilst they await rescue from, well you can guess who comes, and largely what happens from here on in. For much of the movie, we have two parallel storylines to underwhelm us: the unarmed yet remarkably resilient family have to find an abandoned HQ whilst the mercenaries play a sort of level-by-level game navigating the usual island full of beasties adventures that haven’t really advanced much since it’s nearest biological cousin - “Jurassic Park III” (2001). Oddly enough, I didn’t think these visual effects were anywhere near as effective as in the originals. Maybe we are all just too used to these great animals lumbering about on land, breaching like whales at sea, or swooping and pecking relentlessly from the air? Johansson does join in enthusiastically and Jonathan Bailey really has one one of those smiles on his face that suggests he is enjoying his days in front of the green screen knowing it has to be easier than singing “Not Getting Married” on stage eight times a week - and probably better paid. The others really only make up the numbers, though, with a few characters obviously designated as dino-fodder early-on as it rehashes scenarios from just about everything from “Indian Jones” to “Harry Potter”. It might be like comparing apples and pears, but I have to say I found the current “How to Train Your Dragon” a much more enjoyable adventure about man’s relationship with thick-skinned, scaly, predators, because this entirely forgettable film will do little more than slot nicely into the Christmas television schedules with little, if anything, to distinguish about it once it’s grand scale cinema run has concluded. PS: I don’t know about inventing a miracle-cure drug, but whoever designed JB’s glasses ought to patent a design that stays firmly affixed to his face the entire time without moving, cracking, breaking or even slipping down his nose!",696,2025-07-09 12:48:33,2025-07-09 12:52:01
234,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"17 years ago, a group of scientists got the bright idea to mutate dinosaurs. One of those mutations was a Distortus Rex, a Tyrannosaur mutation, also known as the D-Rex. Thanks to a Snickers wrapper, the D-Rex escapes, causing the facility to be shut down.

In the present day, five years after the events of Jurassic World: Dominion, dinosaurs are dying out and can no longer survive Earth’s environment. However, closer to the equator, the tropical atmosphere allows them to flourish. ParkerGenix, a pharmaceutical company, wants to manufacture a drug capable of preventing coronary heart disease. But they need to extract blood samples from three of the largest living dinosaurs: Mosasaurus (water), Titanosaurus (land), and Quetzalcoatlus (sky).

So a group of covert operatives decides to travel illegally to Ile Saint-Hubert to retrieve the samples, where they’ll most likely face certain death and where the D-Rex now roams free.

Jurassic World Rebirth is a lot like smashing the first three Jurassic Park films together with disappointing results. Written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park, The Lost World) and directed by Gareth Evans (Godzilla, Rogue One), Rebirth feels like it recycles all of the major action sequences from the Jurassic Park films with no character development whatsoever.

The motive for every character in Rebirth is money. The film gives these moments where it seems like it’s going to reveal some sort of back story or give some sort of reason for you to care about these emotionless doofuses, but the film quickly backtracks or gives a half-ass response before tumbling into non-seriousness.

Zora (Scarlett Johansson) just finished a mission where she lost someone she was close to. Duncan (Mahershala Ali) had a son who died, which caused his marriage to end. The people with Zora and Duncan are just in it for the money, like them. A family is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean as some last hurrah before the college-age daughter goes off to NYU and has the nerve to act like victims when the Mosasaurus wrecks their boat.

Reuben (Manuel Garcia Rulfo) is a dad that decided to take his two daughters and her daughter’s boyfriend (who is a lethargic turd, by the way) out in a boat in the middle of nowhere because “they’d done it before.” His youngest just wants to eat licorice, the NYU-bound daughter makes terrible decisions, and her boyfriend Xavier (David Iacono) is lazy and unlikeable, and you just want to slap this entire family for two hours straight.

The film opens with the D-Rex escape and then flounders about in trite, boring dialogue for 45 minutes until the Mosasaurus shows up. The problem is that you end up despising all of the human characters. Zora doesn’t take anything seriously, Duncan laughs at everything, Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) is a nerdy paleontologist who has no actual qualities about himself apart from his dinosaur knowledge, and everyone else either whines about everything and survives the entire film and whines forever, or is a loud but eventual dinosaur appetizer.

Rebirth does give more screen time to lesser-known dinosaurs, as velociraptors and T-Rexes are reduced to mere cameos. Most of the screen time is split between the Mosasaurus and Quetzalcoatlus, which allows Rebirth to spend more time in the water than previous Jurassic Park and Jurassic World films. Many people get eaten throughout Jurassic World Rebirth, which is satisfying given how painful it is to endure their presence. It’s also interesting that the dinosaurs get more birdlike throughout the franchise. The Quetzalcoatlus sequences are cool because of the claustrophobic nature of its nest and the sheer design of it, which resembles a bird with its feather-like appearance and beak-like nose.

The character development in Rebirth is nonexistent, but so is an actual ending. All these people die, and the survivors settle on doing this one specific thing, and then the credits roll as they’re riding in the boat away from the deadly dinosaur island. There’s all this dialogue about how they shouldn’t go there, how they know it’s stupid, and how it’s highly deadly and illegal. But then everyone acts surprised and angry when people start dying and things go wrong. The entire film is almost as dumb as the D-Rex design.

Jurassic World Rebirth is the worst film of the Jurassic Park/World franchise because it has nothing original to offer. It spends so much time paying homage to the films that came before it that it lacks its own identity. These are some of the most annoying and entitled cinematic characters of the year and you root for them to end up in an archaic intestinal tract and grunted out into antiquated dino shit.",324,2025-07-26 12:44:38,2025-07-26 12:44:38
235,42,Review from Jenny,"🌟 8/10 – A Thrilling Ride, But Lacking Depth

Jurassic World delivers on the action and spectacle, with thrilling dinosaur chases and jaw-dropping visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat. However, it feels more like a reboot than a reinvention, relying heavily on nostalgia and familiar tropes. The plot lacks the depth and intrigue of the original Jurassic Park, and some character arcs feel a bit underdeveloped. Still, if you're a fan of dino mayhem, it’s a fun, visually impressive ride that’s hard to resist.",97,2025-08-03 19:25:37,2025-08-29 21:56:38
236,87,Review from Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"“Jurassic World Rebirth” swings the franchise back to where it all started, both literally and thematically. Leaning hard into nostalgia, director Gareth Edwards peppers his film with sequences that mirror the most memorable moments from the original “Jurassic Park” so closely you can practically hear the 1993 film reel whirring in the background. But instead of feeling like a cheap rehash, these callbacks often land as thrilling homages that give longtime fans the satisfying jolt of seeing familiar sights updated with today’s high-tech CGI. If you love dinosaurs and all things in the series, this is a more than decent seventh installment.

The story picks up five years after the story line in “Jurassic World: Dominion.” Dinosaurs now barely cling to survival and live solely in isolated tropical zones that mimic their prehistoric habitats. At the behest of greedy drug company representative Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend), an expedition is launched to collect DNA from the last three colossal creatures with the intent to manufacture a revolutionary medical breakthrough (and of course, make the company mega rich). Martin assembles a team of mercenaries (Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali) and a dino scientist (Jonathan Bailey) to help, but things take a turn when they rescue a family (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, Audrina Miranda) stranded at sea.  

While the story and tone may be a slightly different shift from the other films, this one still checks many of the usual blockbuster boxes (and sometimes it does so lazily). I caught myself thinking, “Haven’t I seen this before?” several times, but I stayed engaged with the story. Edwards brings a confident hand to the chaos, balancing massive action set pieces with quieter, tense moments that recall Spielberg’s original. Themes of empathy, redemption, and the perils of unchecked scientific ambition are explored, along with some not-so-subtle commentary on human greed and unlikely heroism. The characters are thoughtfully written too, with several showing personal growth during their adventure. By casting accomplished actors, the performances are strong and elevate the material significantly.

The visual effects are by far the best thing about the film, and they are nothing short of jaw-dropping. The dinosaurs look incredibly lifelike, and it’s thrilling to watch them roar and stomp throughout the tropical island. CGI technology has come a long way, and this is one of the best looking films in the entire series.

“Jurassic World Rebirth” knows what it is: a big summer spectacle. On that front, it absolutely delivers. This entertaining thrill ride is pure popcorn entertainment with just enough heart to make you care.

237,109,Review from omarallahham,"""My review for Jurassic World: Rebirth is ultimately one of disappointment. While the visual effects were commendable and the soundtrack was decent, the film's greatest weakness was its painfully predictable plot; a young child could have easily foreseen most of its developments. In my view, numerous events held the potential for surprising and engaging twists but were instead executed without any real suspense. The performances, sadly, also left room for improvement. I had entered the theater with excitement, but the film failed to deliver, resulting in what I can only describe as a one-time watch reserved for those with time to spare and nothing else on their list. A generous rating would be a 4/10.""",75,2025-08-23 22:37:18,2025-08-29 22:06:53

239,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"The geeky young “Elio” has been orphaned into the care of his military aunt “Olga” who works for Uncle Sam helping folks to navigate the debris that’s floating around in outer space. He likes to speak his own language “Elioese” and is fascinated, obsessed even, with making contact with alien life. He’s convinced that there is intelligent life out there, so imagine his surprise when he hears of a possible response from the Voyager mission sent decades ago. Next thing, well he is transported to the kaleidoscopic “communiverse” where everyone share peace, knowledge and friendship. Well, nearly everyone. The nasty “Grigon” wants to join but when they politely decline he threatens them with obliteration - and a verifiable obliteration at that. Clever these folks may be, but fighters they are not so it falls to “Elio” to prove his worth by trying to negotiate some sort of truce! Off to the big warship he goes, and that’s where he meets “Glordon” and learns a great deal more about his potential foe, and about friendship and loyalty as they embark on some lively escapades. Now there’s not a great deal here that could ever be called original. It’s got plenty of themes and tech rehashed from films gone by, but it’s still an enjoyable and fun tale with a message that resonates engagingly. It challenges stereotypes on just about everything from machismo bullying to parenting and cuddling and though the visuals are up to their usual high standard, fluid, imaginative and colourful, they don’t overwhelm the simplicity of the thrust which is a story about trust friendship. Will you recall it this time next year? Well no - probably not, but it keeps clear enough of too much sentiment, has some tea-time menace, mischief, laser cannons and it also reminded me of when I had a radio ham call sign too.",944,2025-06-25 10:44:46,2025-06-25 10:49:50
240,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"Elio is a heartwarming, intergalactic adventure that once again proves Pixar's mastery in crafting family-friendly stories layered with deeper emotional undercurrents. The voice cast is impeccable, with every performance radiating charm and sincerity, making it easy for viewers of all ages to connect with these vibrant characters. The score, as is typical for the studio, plays a pivotal role in guiding the emotional journey, gently elevating moments of wonder, sadness, and joy without ever feeling overbearing. There's an infectious sense of fun throughout, with plenty of space-faring antics to keep kids engaged, while older audiences will find value in the themes of loneliness, grief, and the universal desire for belonging.

However, Elio doesn't reach the emotional or narrative heights of Pixar's most iconic offerings. Its message, while undoubtedly impactful and accessible, feels too broadly framed to leave a lasting personal mark. The themes are universally relatable, but the movie's refusal to dig deeper into its more profound ideas keeps it from resonating on a soul-piercing level. It's touching, yes, but in a way that feels like a gentle nod rather than a heartfelt embrace. Still, Elio remains a commendable addition to Pixar's filmography - emotionally rich, charmingly performed, and filled with enough heartfelt moments to justify the trip across the stars.

241,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"Elio (Yonas Kibreab) is an 11-year-old boy who has recently lost his parents. He’s been taken in by his aunt Olga (Zoe Saldana). Olga works in orbital analysis and is gone a lot. Feeling like he doesn’t belong anywhere and nobody wants him, Elio finds comfort in interplanetary life. He takes on an obsession with ham radios and attempts to communicate with aliens while simultaneously trying to get abducted nightly.

One night, Elio is finally abducted by aliens. He’s introduced to an incredible new environment with alien species the likes of which the human eye has never seen or interacted with. He wants to stay forever until they reveal that they think he’s the leader of Earth. Elio lies his way into the alien community, but to stay he must risk his life to save them.

There are themes in Elio that are circled back around in elegant fashion. Elio loses his family before the film even begins. He’s also weird enough that he doesn’t have any friends. The film tries to paint Elio in a creative light like he has this big imagination because he’s invented his own language and can lie himself into and out of any situation. But he mostly comes off as a shitty person that treats his hard-working aunt, who only wants to support him and for him to love her, like dirt.

The animated sci-fi adventure film is about Elio coming to terms with the loss of his parents. He feels alone, has low self-esteem, and has extreme acceptance issues. But the film explores what it’s like to find your own family made of new friends and that you’re never really as low or alone as you think you are.

He is initially shipped off to boarding school because of his uncontrollable behavior and inability to not be a destructive shit. Once he’s at the Communiverse, he meets a liquid-like supercomputer named OOOOO. She clones Elio and sends his clone back to Earth so no one will notice that he’s gone. But as Elio checks up on him, he sees what it’s like to be a family with his aunt and becomes homesick.

Visually, the film is at its best when Elio is at the Communiverse. The Communiverse is filled with all sorts of alien leaders from all over the galaxy with the intent of sharing their knowledge with others and hopefully recruiting other respectable leaders. These sequences are filled with all sorts of eccentric creatures while its “alien” explanation allows things like basic physics or logic to be thrown out the window.

Hands down the best character and most enjoyable part of the film is Glordon. He is worm-like and his design was inspired by larval insects and microbiotic creatures like the tardigrade. His mouth seems to go on forever and is overrun with teeth kind of like a Dune sandworm. He can spin web like a spider and is heat and lava-resistant. He looks menacing and scary, but once he gets an English translator has an adorable little kid’s voice and is super expressive even though he doesn’t have any eyes. The friendship he develops with Elio has way more of an impact than the one the film forces him into with his aunt.

Unfortunately, Elio crawls at a slug-like pace through what feels like the longest hour and a half of the summer. It struggles through its first hour as Elio lies to everyone around him, gets in way over his head with the aliens, and attempts to abandon his aunt forever. Elio’s big plan is to join the alien community and leave Earth with no intention of ever going back. But apart from the enjoyable montage of Elio showing Glordon the Communiverse, the entire movie is just “Oh no, I lied too hard and don’t know what to do now.”

Animated films and TV shows have used slow-motion before, but Elio has some of the worst slow-motion effects in the history of animation. The slow-mo here looks like it was a decision that was made in post-production as the effect doesn’t look to be part of the animation but the editing of the film itself. It’s done in a way that makes you think the projector is acting up or something. It’s so jittery and awkward looking and the intended effect is probably not whatever you see on screen.

Elio is visually fun to look at and it gets somewhat entertaining in its last 20 minutes or so, but is otherwise a big, disappointing bowl of intergalactic garbage. The film chooses to follow an unlikeable character who is a brat the entire time and the main takeaway is that he shouldn’t be so much of a shithead and be decent to those who actually care about him for some reason. There’s something fun and whimsical here trapped inside the body of an entitled, lie-spewing thundercunt.",120,2025-07-04 02:29:27,2025-07-04 02:29:27

243,37,Review from John Chard,"Some birds aren't meant to be caged.

The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",188,2016-07-10 00:16:50,2024-05-16 15:22:14

This story of another man wrongfully in prison for murder joins the list of about every other movie about a man sent to prison for murdering his wife.

People are not gods. They are souls and spirits that can only withstand so much brainwashing. 
Add to that, the story plods along with really nothing new to add. It's a very formula movie.

253,37,Review from John Chard,"This rum is red, man!

In spite of author Stephen King not being happy with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his novel, The Shining (1980) has proved to be a critical and commercial darling.

It may not be in the spirit that King wanted, but it's undeniably a skillful piece of film making, a mixture of beauty and terror, of bravura techniques and simple but effective scares. With quality acting performances to match as well. The story unfolds at a deliberately slow pace, claustrophobia oozes from practically every frame, while the narrative smarts brings to bear the ghosts of the human and supernatural kind, all bone chillingly rendered for great effect by the vast spaces - the cold winter grounds outside - of the Overlook Hotel.

It's not all perfect, the screenplay is very average, which makes Kubrick's work even more impressive, but with that comes the wave of feeling about style over substance. A churlish gripe? Maybe? But with Jack Nicholson on scenery chewing overdrive and Kubrick pulling the strings, The Shining still represents a highlight in horror. A horror movie that all horror fans should see at least once - and in the best format available as well! 8/10",959,2015-11-01 00:53:21,2024-05-16 15:22:12

255,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

With Doctor Sleep, an almost 40-year sequel to The Shining, being released this week, now it’s the perfect time to revisit one of the greatest horror movies of all-time, as well as one of the most influential directors ever, Stanley Kubrick. I know, I know… Spoiler-free? For a movie released in 1980? Well, first of all, there’s always someone who still didn’t watch it. Secondly, as deeper we get into the 21st century, the more the 60s/70s/80s/90s movies are forgotten. And finally, if there’s a movie which I don’t need spoilers to explain how outstanding it is, it’s The Shining. With that said …

It has always been one of my favorite horror films ever. It’s not perfect (no film is) and some aspects don’t work as well now as they did 5/10/20 years ago. When it came out, Kubrick’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel was received with mixed reactions. King himself criticized the movie. However, less than 10 years later, Kubrick’s film was already being reevaluated. Nowadays, it’s considered a cult classic, and it’s easy to understand why. From the countless homages to the hundreds of comedic parodies, The Shining has some of the most memorable lines ever. Just this year, we had It: Chapter Two mimicking Jack Nicholson’s “Here’s Johnny!” scene, for example. And then there’s the mysterious “redrum”…

However, the movie’s biggest influence is its technical achievements. I apologize in advance if this review becomes too technical, but it’s impossible not to address the arguably best component of the film. This movie was one of the first to use Steadicam (a camera stabilizer mount which allows for smooth shots, even on irregular surfaces, isolating the operator’s movement), something that became so common that people don’t even praise anymore. Honestly, there are still a bunch of recent movies that have terrible camera work, so I’m one of those who defend that the Steadicam use shouldn’t be taken for granted. Especially how Kubrick did, barely above the floor, which originated the extension “low-mode” that now exists and allows for the operator to easily shoot lower than its waist.

With the innovative use of the technical equipment, Kubrick’s delivers a masterclass in framing (composing the visual content of a series of frames as seen from a point of view). So much that it became worthy of studying. Almost every shot in this movie has a visual clue or an underlying theme. If you ever feel bored during your viewing, then you’re (probably) not “watching it right”. You’re not truly thinking about it or looking around the characters. This isn’t a generic horror flick with monsters or demons jump scaring you. It’s heavy on visual storytelling, so if you don’t pay attention, you’re going to reach the film’s climactic and enigmatic ending and feel that you missed something.

From the mise-en-scene (arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, hence this French term that means “placing on stage“) having several blood-red colors to the wide shots clearly showing “exit” signs and giving the maze-vibe of the enormous hotel, the imminent danger is visually spread out across the movie. The symmetry/mirroring is absolutely crucial to not only deliver key plot points but to create this sense of reality vs fantasy. From the hotel’s structure and decoration (everything is incredibly symmetric) to the growing use of mirrors (these are heavily used to either literally translate words or to show the descent into madness), Kubrick’s framing is what leaves viewers scratching their heads, still to this date.

You’ll always find something new on another viewing. It might be from 1980, but it’s a movie that requires your full attention. Don’t underestimate films from the 20th century like you can’t be surprised by a film “that old” (you’ll be dumbfounded by dozens). If John Alcott’s cinematography is impressive, then what can I write about Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind’s haunting score? Nowadays, scores are more based on creating an emotional impact on specific moments. However, throughout the film and during dialogues, even epic films still have a subtlest approach to these scenes, and the music is either very quiet or completely inexistent.

In The Shining, the score is part of the conversation. If a character feels fear or danger is imminent, a simple heartbeat can elevate such a moment. If two characters gradually turn their dialogue into something more violent and aggressive, the music makes sure to accompany that descent into craziness. It’s a perfect horror film’s score. Technically, I’ll stop there because no words will be able to express how mind-blowing Kubrick’s visionary methods are. He’s one of the greatest directors ever, maybe even the most influential. Hopefully, his work will always be remembered and never stop being relevant.

Story-wise, The Shining also inspired a whole new generation. Everyone knows and loves the key moments of the film, but it’s the clever exposition that satisfies me. Every piece of information is given through either an incredibly captivating dialogue or visual clues/actions. I watched the 144min version of the film (the European version has 25min less than the American version, and the latter has a final scene at a hospital edited out by Kubrick himself), and pretty much every single scene is intended to mean something. It can be important new information or an update on a previous plot point, but every single sequence has a particular purpose.

Jack Nicholson commands the screen with a phenomenal performance, one of his career’s best. His script might be very well-written, but his delivery and commitment to the role are astonishing. He carries one-take, extense dialogues seamlessly. Credit to Kubrick for making a movie with at least 2/3-minute takes, sure, but Nicholson is able to transform a good scene into a fantastic one. Danny Lloyd delivers one of my favorite young performances ever. His voice as Tony is a great accomplishment, and he seems to understand his surroundings, in a way that I never felt like I needed to “go easy” on him because he’s just impeccable. 

Shelley Duvall, however, is a mixed bag for me. Over-the-top displays were better received at the time, but almost 40 years later, her performance does reach an unbearable level a few times. She’s an amazing counterpart for Nicholson and she stands her own within their dialogues, but when she’s alone or in an emotionally troubled moment, she’s too much to handle. Scatman Crothers doesn’t have that much screentime as Dick Halloran, but he shines every time he has to deliver a line. Some people complain about the slow pacing, but I love how it helps elevate the suspense and building up moments of immense tension. While the ending might be just a tad abrupt, the final image of the film stays with us forever, and after all this time, I still didn’t settle on my own theory.

All in all, The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all-time. Stanley Kubrick’s masterclass in framing with his play on symmetry and mirrors is evident, so even if you don’t study the art of filmmaking, it’s clear that these two themes are vital to telling the story. In addition to his framing, his use of the innovative Steadicam and his notable mise-en-scene shaped an entire new generation that never misses a chance of paying homage to his work. Besides the impressive technical achievements, Jack Nicholson delivers a memorably haunting performance. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years, and new theories keep coming up. While I’ll keep trying to settle on my own interpretation, don’t you dare spend the rest of your life without (re)watching this cult classic.

258,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"""Jack Torrance"" is a writer who suffers from a chronic lack of inspiration. To help overcome his block, he takes a job as a winter caretaker and relocates his family to the remote, huge, ""Overlook Hotel"" where he hopes he can focus! Gradually, the bleak Arctic conditions outside and the never ending, brightly lit, corridors and rooms long since abandoned start to affect his mind. When he ventures towards the expressly off-limits room 237 it all begins to get truly out of hand. Shelley Duvall is fabulous as his put-upon wife ""Wendy"" as is Danny Lloyd as their gifted, but largely terrified son ""Danny"". Kubrick is on top form as he cleverly capitalises on Stephen King's terrifying story helping the star create a wonderful sense of madness and menace tinged with quite a bit of comedy that leaves us with an horror film that is truly scary for a change! Credit also to the make up folks - they manage to help Nicholson transfer from obnoxious writer to axe-wielding psychopath; especially around the eyes, with real impact. 40 yeas on, it still packs a punch.",911,2023-06-07 13:50:36,2023-06-07 13:50:36
259,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"_Sisu_ is an hour and a half slaughter fest loaded with despicable characters that you will actually enjoy seeing being ripped to pieces.

It is a film that endorses its simplicity a bit too heavily, but is an otherwise immensely entertaining piece of popcorn entertainment that will satisfy action junkies.

260,5,Review from MovieGuys,"

Sisu is a Finnish film, not from Quentin Tarantino but certainly cut from the same variety of gruesome cloth. The film is visceral and over the top, celebrating slaughter, in a variety of horrifically novel, ways. 

I personally found the whole affair gratuitous, to be honest. What dwelt at the back of my mind and I feel should be remembered, is war is not a joke or a carnival. 

I grew up surrounded by people who lived and in some cases, served during WWII. The few tales they told were sad, often tragic and spoke of people trapped into a reality, not of their making or their wanting.

On the upside, Sisu is well paced, exposition driven and has lots of variety in its action. Acting is solid but exposition, is really this flicks, true driver. On a certain level too, this film, recalls spaghetti Westerns, with a WWII, make over. 

In summary, if you like splatter style films, you'll probably like this, Just keep in mind, real people lived and died in WWII, on both sides. War is not a game, its not an entertainment.",159,2023-05-17 20:42:40,2023-05-17 20:52:38

262,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"I did quite enjoy this, but you really do have to be prepared to leave your common sense at the door. It's all about a man ""Aatami"" (Jorma Tommila) who having had a brutal WWII already, has taken refuge in the remote Finnish wilderness where he is panning for - and finds - gold. Packing up, he sets off for civilisation but en route, encounters a dishevelled Nazi tank patrol under the command of ""Bruno"" (Aksel Hennie). Initially, they have little interest in the pilgrim, but some gunfire and explosions shortly after he passes them piques their interest and soon the most perilous of manhunts is engaged. The ""Sisu"" myth is based around a person who is not immortal, but who simply refuses to die - and ""Aatami"" certainly fits the bill. He flirts with knives, bullets, landmines and even the noose but death clearly doesn't want him just yet! Can he get his gold to the bank? It is gory, this film, but I found in quite a light-hearted way. Limbs blown hither and tither but somehow not in a menacing, or scary, fashion. Indeed, at times the action is actually mildly entertaining - especially when the women prisoners are given the opportunity for some good old-fashioned revenge. It's told with an hybrid Guy Ritchie or Sergio Leone style, episodically, and for the first hour works quite well. The tail end, though, falls away as the film - always of questionable plausibility - becomes just a little bit too ""A-Team"". There isn't much dialogue to comment on - no bad thing; and the action comes thick and fast in a production that is wonderfully illustrative of the bleakness of this environment (and of some with an human soul).",981,2023-06-01 07:49:20,2023-06-01 07:49:20
263,87,Review from Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"There’s a great deal of pleasure to be had in watching one man violently dispatch dozens of evil Nazis, and the WWII action film “Sisu” is a brutal, bloody delight. This midnight movie from writer-director Jalmari Helander embraces a comic book mentality that’s balanced with gory kills, a hearty dose of wit, and a potent story about courage and determination.

With the second world war coming to an end, a solitary prospector (Jorma Tommila) in the Lapland wilderness of Northern Finland searches for gold with his last remaining companion: his dog. The pair cross paths with a band of Nazis who have left a path of scorched-earth destruction in their wake. Seeing an easy target, the Nazis steal the man’s large bag of gold. What they didn’t bargain for is that the man they’ve pissed off is no ordinary miner. The prospector is an ex-commando who is the stuff of legends, and he becomes a one-man death squad who will do anything to get his gold back. Unfortunately for the thieves, this means killing every single Nazi that comes into sight.

The film’s title comes from the Finnish concept of “sisu,” a white-knuckled form of courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. It’s a kick-ass idea to build a story upon, and Helander creates a myth that seems both outrageous yet plausible. The film is divided into chapters, each adding another level of depth to the narrative (including an unexpected and rousing piece that celebrates female empowerment). Viewers looking for nonstop action may find the film to be slow in parts, but the character development is well done (in reality, the pacing is almost perfect).

Helander understands the real reason you’re here, though: to watch a good old fashioned Nazi massacre. Once the violence starts, it does not disappoint. There are shootings, stabbings, hangings, immolations, and all manners of complete annihilation. Body parts fly, men are crushed by tanks, and a horse explodes, just to name a few. As the kills pile up, the cheers for the body count of dead Nazis grow louder.

“Sisu” is a skillfully crafted action film that’s a ton of fun. There’s plenty of bloody killing, but also an absorbing dramatic arc that quietly builds into a deafening crescendo.",79,2023-08-04 07:13:18,2023-08-04 07:13:18

Or, if you just like watching Nazis get the living shit beat out of them, (I know I do) this is the film to watch. Or maybe you just want to see raped women get empowered for revenge. Sisu has all that. And it's bloody.

I also love words that have no direct translation to English, like the Portuguese word soldade, or the German Schadenfreude. Now I've learned another, the Finnish word Sisu: A white-knuckled courage and unimaginable determination.",872,2023-08-06 04:08:09,2023-08-06 04:08:09

Jalmari Helander director and writer did a good job on this one, that is divided in chapters - similarities with Rambo III and John Wick aren't so coincide since the production crew worked in John Wick.

Wait for gory deaths, and very good choreographies on the sequences of fighting. The story is also original in it's way and reminds a lot Tarantino.

Jorma Tommila as Aatami the protagonist does a good job, better that Keanu btw. There are some goofs as the post WWII tank used by the germans but ok.

268,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"When dad “Chris” (Scott Eastwood) and her aunt “Jenny” (Willa Fitzgerald) are killed in a car accident, the young “Clara” (Mckenna Grace) finds her relationship with her now widowed mum (Allison Williams) becoming a bit strained. This might also be because she has recently started seeing local school heart-throb “Miller” (Mason Thames) who already has a girlfriend and so might just be a bit one-track minded? Also on her radar is her mother’s long term friend “Jonah” (Dave Franco) who was married to “Jenny” and so is now also grieving as he attempts to bring up his newborn baby. “Jonah” happens on some clues that explain, pretty uncomfortably, just why their respective spouses were in the same car and that changes their dynamic, a change they decide to keep from the young “Clara”. What chance they can keep their bombshell to themselves though - especially as their own relationship is looking like it is about to enliven? With the scene set, we focus mainly on the two teenagers and it becomes something shockingly cheesy. There’s way, way, too much dialogue and with Franco largely sidelined it becomes one of those predictable family melodramas that never really addresses any of the elephants on the room; takes a fairly cavalier attitude to grief and makes very little attempt to add depth to any of it’s principle characters especially that of “Miller” (whose closing scene creeped me out a little, too). It looks good, but is insubstantial fluff that ought to have gone straight to a streamer and Clancy Brown has come a long way from his time as the menacing “Kurgan” - and not in a good way, either. Regretting or forgetting? Both would seem to apply here.",926,2025-10-26 12:48:27,2025-10-26 12:51:47
269,124,Review from futuretv,"The Godfather Review by Al Carlson

The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.
The Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.
The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.
Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. 
This film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.",45,2014-04-10 20:09:40,2021-06-23 15:57:25

A masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the story telling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)

271,117,Review from drystyx,"While I'm writing this, The Godfather is still beloved by people who love it simply because they are told they have to love it. 
It's written by a mobster with the sole intention of depicting the lead mobsters as demi gods. Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the ""Mafia"" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.
This is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.
The movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. 
There just isn't anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people. It's totally Hollywood in its depressing nature, and even in the seventies it was a formula film.",648,2023-04-02 03:49:51,2023-04-03 16:45:04
272,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious ""Corleone"" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother ""Fredo"" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.",591,2023-05-28 11:02:44,2023-05-28 11:02:44

274,127,Review from RalphRahal,"The Godfather (1972), directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece that redefined storytelling in film. Based on Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola’s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art.

At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando’s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.

Coppola’s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the “Prince of Darkness,” enhances the film’s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota’s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.

A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history.

The Godfather isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. It’s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",443,2024-12-17 16:31:01,2024-12-17 16:31:01

278,129,Review from sandros,"There is no need to say a lot about the movie, it was very very very nice. If you don't care about F1 but just casually like any competition just give it a go. It is really hard for me to watch a longer video without doing something else too but I watched the entire length of this movie without thinking anything about doing something else or eat or touching my phone. Some more thoughts if you already watched the movie and just want to read things others say but you really should not care about: could it have been better? yes, i missed more info about certain events or characters. not much more, but just a little bit more. the ending? perfect. I expected something else then it still delivered. I don't really know how to say this but you can feel proud watching this, the entire way through the movie. There is nothing to really cringe about and I really appreciate this. This alone makes this movie in the top for me. A lot of new and relatively new movies (especially drama, fantasy, super hero things) are cringefest and in parts uncomfortable to watch. This is not.

279,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"With Sir Lewis Hamilton and F1 media veteran Ian Holmes amongst those at the helm of this production, you can be certain that it’s going to be as an authentic story of all things F1 (can’t be bothered finding the trademark symbol) as you’re ever likely to see. It’s all about team “Ruben” (Javier Bardem) whose cars couldn’t beat an egg and so is looking at ending up broke! His remaining driver is British rookie “Joshua” (Damson Idris) but he’s nowhere near experienced enough to make any impact on the problem. For that, he needs to coax back “Sonny” (Brad Pitt) who did drive these cars twenty years ago but hung up his helmet after an accident and then became an itinerant driver eking a living across the USA. Can he be tempted? Well we’d have no film if he wasn’t so the next question is: can he manage to salvage this operation before it’s sold for scrap? True to form with this sport, what now ensues sees all the glitz and glamour of circuits around the world; money no object cars, training and equipment; testosterone galore both in the car and with team tech director “Kate” (Kerry Condon) as well as a whole slew of rule manipulating, crashes, downright cheating and I have to say, some of the best action and in-car photography I’ve seen on a big screen. Indeed, I could cheerfully have lived without the dramatic characterisation here altogether, and just stuck to the tensely directed and really compelling action sequences that, especially using the in-car cameras, is genuinely quite exciting to watch. You really do get a sense of the speed of the cars racing round the tracks and of the phenomenal engineering that goes into the design and manufacture of these cars that at times look no more substantial than an Airfix kit. Pitt is in his element here delivering a character that’s a lovable rogue meets smug git whilst Idris comes across entirely naturally as the youngster out of his depth but willing and determined to learn. The soundtrack from the likes of Queen and Led Zeppelin livens up what I’d have to say isn’t Hans Zimmer’s most memorable score, and with the last half hour largely devoid of the romantic and emotional clutter, we watch something that shows us this circus in full pomp. You don’t need to be remotely interested in this topic to enjoy this film, you only really need a pulse and a great big screen.",614,2025-07-02 19:58:30,2025-07-02 20:03:22
280,130,Review from Horseface,"I am so glad I'm F1 illiterate.

Even though I know basically nothing about this sport, I can still feel how unrealistic everything is. The opening scene had me going, ""Yeah right. Calm down already."" 

But really, it doesn't matter. This has the hallmarks of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, it's dumb and it's fun. It has to be somewhat dumb to be this much fun. Everytime there was a reference made to the '90s, I couldn't help but think that that, too, was Jerry's hayday. Con Air anyone? The Rock? 

It's everything that we miss from the ideology-laden racist and sexist pedantic sub-AI-level slop that Hollywood churns out these days, and it's kinda ironic that we're getting it from woke Apple. But I'm not complaining.

Watching this I had flashbacks to Top Gun Maverick, which was also such a breath of uncomplicated popcorn-throwing fresh air, and lo and behold this is from the same director.

Absolutely worth a watch, possibly infuriating if you're not motorsport illiterate.",63,2025-08-29 18:05:59,2025-08-29 18:05:59

282,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Someone must have got fed up with the constant slating of the ""After..."" series and thought - ""I know, let's make something that will really make those films look good"". Guess what, they succeeded. ""Noah"" (Nicole Wallace) has had to relocate to live with her mother and her new husband in a palatial home that also happens to be occupied by her rather weedy step-brother ""Nick"" (Gabriel Guevara). Now the two do not hit it off. He's a bit of a cocky git and she's equally no-nonsense about things - so that ought to be the end. Rock and hard place kind of thing. Nope, no such luck. For almost two hours this takes us on the most predictable of romantic dramas that actually manages to incorporate car chases, fist fighting, sex, familial drama, more (beach) sex and a kidnapping. I would say you couldn't make it up, but clearly the series-prone author Mercedes Ron did in her novel. Amazon have early thrown some cash at this, but little of it was spent on the screenplay and the acting - well Wallace reminded me a little of Shailene Woodley but ""Nick"" is just an overblown drip - with or without his clothes. I know I'm not the demographic for this, but yikes - I wonder who really would appreciate this banal film. Bring back ""90210""!!",247,2023-10-21 15:05:19,2023-10-21 15:05:19

284,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Oh well, all good things must come to an end - except, well, this isn’t really very good. It’s reminiscent of the second Enfield Haunting one (2016) as the Smurl family start to find their home is being terrorised by a spirit that this time has been malevolently lingering on the land that their new home has been built on. Initially, the Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are reluctant to get involved, but when a priest is found dangling down the stairwell of the bishop’s residence and then their daughter “Judy” (Mia Tomlinson) - whom we learn had her own near-death experience at birth - gets involved with the struggling and terrified family, it falls to them and her unsuspecting but plucky boyfriend “Tony” (Ben Hardy) to try and save the day before the body count gets any larger. I liked Hardy in “Unicorns” (2023). He brings an enthusiasm to the roles he plays and he actually does fine here. The rest of it, though, is entirely by-the-numbers stuff only now we are in the attic with a mysterious mirror. Every scenario that involves a degree of peril also involves a degree of stupidity. Who walks into a darkened room at the best of times without turning on the light? Let alone when the place is creaking and moaning. Farmiga looks more like she belongs in “Downton Abbey” every time she appears and at well over two hours, this is seriously strung out as it tries to incorporate familial and investigative history into this fairly repetitious series of spooky set-pieces. Sorry, but this just isn’t anyone’s finest hour, the story is pretty unoriginal and I went away hoping that this was, indeed, the last rites.",131,2025-09-11 18:23:26,2025-09-19 09:40:02

In the 40+ years of being engrossed with watching any and as many movies as possible, this one has the most heart tugging feeling I've ever felt in a horror film. Tremendous effort went into this project, and in saying it works... Terrifying and Haunting and loaded with fear beyond reason for all those involved.

287,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"An essential element of any love story is chemistry between the lead characters, even if it takes an unconventional form. Regrettably, however, that’s exactly what’s missing in director Bing Liu’s debut narrative feature, based on the novel by Atticus Lish. Told in the form of a narrated letter/journal entry to her late film, the film chronicles the unlikely love story of Aishe (Sebiye Behtiyar), an ambitious, sharp-witted twentysomething Uyghur woman who illegally immigrates to the US, and Skinner (Fred Hechinger), a troubled young American soldier who just returned stateside after three tours of duty in the Middle East and is now apparently unsuccessfully battling PTSD. They meet by chance in New York, where Aishe toils to make ends meet working long hours in a Chinatown restaurant and Skinner tries to sort out his life and his mental state. Together they embark on a rollercoaster romance with a series of breakups and reconciliations as Aishe tries to decide on marriage or a life of solitude, peace of mind and independence, all the while staying ahead of immigration authorities, and Skinner seeks to find a stable existence that may or may not involve the love of his life, depending on his mood, focus and ever-changing inclinations for a steady, traditional relationship. To be honest, the basic premise behind this release is inherently something of a stretch, made worse by a narrative that becomes meandering and redundant after a time. But the bigger issue here is that I never bought the sincerity of the connection between the protagonists, right from the moment they met and at virtually every turn during the course of their on-again/off-again partnership. The reason? Despite her inexperience with romance, Aishe seems far too smart and determined to chart the course of her life to put up with Skinner’s unpredictability and capriciousness. In fact, after their first emotionally tense confrontation, I was astounded by their subsequent reconciliation, given that she seems like the type who would have walked away and not looked back without a second thought. Granted, an immigration-driven marriage might resolve some of the issues of her legal status in the US, but with Skinner? It’s true that she has an apparently deep sense of compassion for his condition, but, being the fiercely headstrong individual that she is, I can’t see that empathy being enough in itself to make her want to stay with him on a long-term basis. What’s more, Aishe’s back story often feels incomplete, and Skinner’s is even more nonexistent, an aspect of the story that makes their actions and responses all the more perplexing at times. In all, this offering is half-baked and implausible across the board, making for a screen romance that’s unengaging and unrealistic, one not worth the time.",619,2025-10-01 23:57:44,2025-10-01 23:57:44
288,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"The pink-maned ""Freddy"" is more akin to a poodle than a wolf, but he is spirited when it comes to helping out his pack of lupine super-heroes who try to help out those in distress! Fed up constantly being put down, he looks skyward and makes a wish. Next thing, there's a moon spirit ""Moopoo"" before him and he's no longer a wimp. Thing is, though, his new blue friend needs life energy to survive, and so they have to find a way to repatriate him with his own kind on the moon else a catastrophe will befall all of us! There's only one way to do that, and that's to find ""Max"" - an ostracised wolf who lives deep in the forest and who possesses the magic spell required. Off they go on their search, but will the grudge-bearing ""Max"" even want to help them or might she have her own cunning plan to avenge herself on those who cast her out? It's quite a fun family adventure this but it does struggle to find it's audience. The very young probably won't appreciate the sense of (tea time) menace, especially towards the end - and those a bit older will probably be put off by the initially rather childish characterisation of ""Freddy"". It's also probably twenty minutes too long, but as a simple light-hearted drama it does what it says on the tin, touching of the aspirations of all of us when we are young and wanting to fit in, to lead and be valued. Forgettable stuff, but it's decently animated and watchable enough.",499,2024-10-06 10:57:14,2024-10-06 10:57:14

290,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Whatever happened to Brenton Thwaites? For some reason that crossed my mind as this thoroughly entertaining fantasy adventure gets off to a rollicking start and keeps going. Now if you are the “Hagar”-esque Viking chief (Gerard Butler) expecting your son to take over as fearless dragon-chaser after you, why would you call him “Hiccup”? Might as well call him “Buttercup”? Anyway, that hapless lad (Mason Thames) maybe isn’t the most adept on the muscle front but cerebrally he has something of the Leonardo Da Vinci to him as he determines to set about devising a weapon that will tackle the most formidable of their foes - the “Night Fury”. Well, would you believe it - his contraption actually works, but instead of slaying the thing this young man decides that the decades of combat between the species has accomplished nothing, so he decides a bit of co-operation might be in order instead. Of course, he has to be fairly clandestine about this as his dad will go ape if he finds out and fellow, and competitive, student “Astrid” (Nico Parker) - on whom he has a terrible crush - might decide to take her axe to both him and his new friend. There are a few slight modifications from the animation (2010) but otherwise it largely sticks to the story with a lovely hammy effort from Butler, an enjoyably mischievous one from his multi-appendage sidekick “Gobber” (Nick Frost) and two solid performances from the leads. It’s Thames who really steals the show amongst the humans, with a cheeky and personable effort which must have been quite a task as he spent much of the filming dangling in front of a green screen. As to the visuals, they are great. A combination of dragons galore, huge scale pyrotechnics and loads of imagination immerses you into a story of family and friendship without even the vaguest hint of the moralising that often peppers this genre. They say that, aerodynamically, a bee ought never to be able to fly: well I think that could be said of almost all of the critters here as they dart about menacingly and colourfully for a couple of hours of what is really good fun. It’s well worth a cinema outing as the whole thing looks and sounds great on a big screen and dare I say it, I might quite like a sequel if they can keep the standard of storytelling up to that of the imagery.",337,2025-06-18 17:57:54,2025-06-18 18:07:02
291,28,Review from Chris Sawin,"The How to Train Your Dragon live-action remake is a shot-for-shot remake of the original 2010 animated film. It is DreamWorks Animation's first foray into live-action and original screenwriter and director Dean DeBlois returns.

The few highlights of the live-action version of the film are that the majority of the dragons transition to live-action or are computer generated to extremely satisfying results. Monstrous Nightmare (the red dragon with the long snout that can ignite its entire body on fire) is exceptionally cool.

Visually, How to Train Your Dragon is stunning. Many live-action shots are realistic copies of what was accomplished in the animated film which is a major accomplishment regardless of whether it was shot on location or required a green screen and various other visual effects. No one is taking away from the fact that the film looks incredible.

Gerard Butler, the one returning actor from the animated films, acts his ass off as Stoick. Butler’s performance was already solid, but him embodying the character and dressing as him brings out more emotion and more passion in his acting. DeBlois claims that Universal Studios wanted to tell the same story with this film; to embellish what made the animated film great. DeBlois says that the live-action version enhances the original, but the only significant enhancement is Butler’s performance.

All of the jokes and story points are the same, which don’t hit the same in live-action. It seems like an obvious fault to say that a live-action film just isn’t as animated or as energetic as an animated film but that is exactly the case here. Performances lack that cartoonish nature that made How to Train Your Dragon entertaining, funny, touching, and memorable. None of the humor works here as none of the other casting choices work like they’re supposed to.

The only reason this was remade was to add people of color to the cast. This would be fine if it was done for a valid reason, but nearly all of the black actors are background characters or have one or two lines. Ruffnut and Tuffnut are no longer actual twins. Ruffnut is suddenly a BBW and both twins are redheads. Julian Dennison (The Hunt for the Wildepeople, Deadpool 2) is Fishlegs and his performance is mostly fine as he captures the same energy, but it’s just too brief to make much of an impact.

Astrid is now portrayed by Nico Parker while Gothi, the town elder, is played by Naomi Wirthner. Both characters are now portrayed by biracial actors. Wirthner is fine as Gothi because Gothi doesn’t have any lines. Parker portrays Astrid as a super bitch. In the original film, Astrid was trying to prove she was the strongest despite being a girl.

Hiccup’s unorthodox methods and seeming entitlement annoyed her and the ride on Toothless softened the character and represented the fact that Berk’s stance on dragons could be altered. Now Astrid stomps around like an entitled brat for what feels like a two-hour tantrum. Not to mention Hiccup (Mason Thames) looks 25 and Astrid (Parker) looks 12. Thames is younger than Parker in real life, but still.

I revisited the first two How to Train Your Dragon films before seeing the live-action remake and watched How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World after. With a franchise, it’s usually a good idea to revisit the older films so major characters and story points can be fresh on your mind. Doing so before this film made it incredibly boring. This new version of the film is made for people who either haven’t seen the original film in a very long time or for a new generation of people who have never seen it. Revisiting the other films just made this one feel boring and long; the live-action film is both of those things but seeing the other films beforehand made it feel even more boring and long.

At least with live-action Disney films the animated films are used as a base and new material is built around that. The live-action Lilo & Stitch at least had the balls to try a new ending and Jumba was turned into the film’s major villain with no redemption arc. An exact replication feels so unnecessary on all accounts and something worked along the way because a live-action sequel is already greenlit.

Dean DeBlois and Universal Studios have somehow recreated an incredible film about dragons and the struggle to survive and turned it into this lifeless, carbon-copy shell of its former self. Hiccup’s initial riding of Toothless has this magical and tingle-inducing aura about it in the original film and here it just feels like retreaded terrain with no charisma. This is a film aimed to enhance the filmmakers and studio’s pockets and nothing more.",240,2025-07-26 12:39:13,2025-07-26 12:39:13

It is certainly watchable but I found myself a bit bored having seen most of this before in the 2010 version. That said, the cast was pretty good, and I did like Nico Parker as Astrid.

""She Rides Shotgun tells a relatively simple, even formulaic story - a man on the run, a redemption arc, a family bond forged in the fire of survival.

It doesn't reinvent the genre, nor does it try to.

294,87,Review from Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Adapted from Jordan Harper’s award-winning novel, “She Rides Shotgun” is a raw, riveting, and emotionally charged crime thriller that delivers a gritty and brutal, sometimes beautiful, and often deeply unsettling story about violence, survival, and the complicated bonds between a father and daughter. Featuring a tight script that’s effectively written and two shockingly strong lead performances, this is a sleeper that you don’t want to miss. 

Taron Egerton gives a tough, layered performance as Nate, a recently released ex-con whose past catches up with him the moment he’s free. With an extensive skinhead gang gunning for his blood, Nate is forced to take his estranged 11-year-old daughter Polly (in an absolutely incredible star-making performance from Ana Sophia Heger) on the run. Their flight from danger becomes a twisted road trip of survival that forces both of them to learn from each other in ways neither is fully prepared for.

The script is tight and incredibly effective, absent of wasted moments and forced sentimentality. It’s dark and unrelenting, packed with gritty, emotional storytelling that refuses to play it safe. There’s very little hope in this world, but just enough humanity to keep you rooting for these two damaged souls. The dynamic between Nate and Polly is the heart of the film, and their evolving relationship is as heartbreaking as it is compelling. Polly’s slow transformation from scared little girl to someone almost comfortable in (and sometimes excited by) the world of crime is disturbing, but it’s handled with care, never glamorized, and is always tragic.

Heger gives one of the strongest child performances in years. She’s magnetic, complex, and completely believable. It’s a breakout role that could (and should) launch a massive career for the young actor. Egerton matches her, showing both grit and emotional vulnerability as a man trying to outrun his sins while teaching his daughter how to survive in a world he helped corrupt. The casting is absolutely perfect, and it elevates the movie tenfold.

The film builds toward a chaotic finale which doesn’t quite land as solidly as the rest of the movie, especially because parts of it are very unbelievable. But even that can’t overshadow how well-constructed the journey is. This is a story that’s less about plot twists and more about psychological impact. It’s the kind of film that keeps viewers emotionally involved.

With its powerful and emotionally bruising tale of loyalty, vengeance, and the terrible cost of love in a broken world, “She Rides Shotgun” is not an easy watch, but it’s a damn good one.

295,130,Review from Horseface,"Jesus Christ, Ana Sophia Heger is INSANE! Where did this girl come from? I don't remember ever seeing a performance this strong from a child actress. I'm blown away, and praying she won't self-destruct, so we can enjoy her talent for decades to come.

Pair that with Taron Egerton's performance, and the crazy chemistry between these two actors, and you just get jaw-dropping moment after gasp-inducing moment. 

There are times when you can't help but think they must've been editing out gasps and sobs from the crew. And times when you just know there was a quiet ""Okay, cut,"" and then silence for a long while. 

I'm still wiping tears from my eyes. If there's any justice or sense to the Oscars (there isn't), this girl will take Best Actress.

The story has issues, especially towards the end, but WATCH IT for the acting and father-daughter chemistry.

I will watch this many times more.",447,2025-08-29 15:08:19,2025-08-29 15:10:27
296,5,Review from MovieGuys,"'She Rides Shotgun"" is one of the better films to come out this year. 

A novel adaptation, its core strength, is the simply mesmerising and deeply moving performances, from the main actors Taron Egerton and Ana Sophia Heger.

A father and his daughter caught in a dysfunctional, ultimately doomed relationship, that's defined by the desperate love they share, in a cold, feral world, that preys on the weak and vulnerable. 

The only downsides I could see here was underlying message, of predatory (dog eat dog) social inequality, feels watered down.Its not helped by the need to define the criminals, by their race. Nor by the candy coated image presented of the US state system of care for orphans, which has a well established reputation, for being awful. 

In summary, ""She Rides Shotgun"" is in most respects, a remarkable film. Its emotional impact, with exceptional chemistry between its lead's, defines it. Its not perfect, certainly but its still head and shoulders above most films of 2025, thus far. A must see.",530,2025-08-30 23:37:53,2025-08-30 23:37:53
297,82,Review from SWITCH.,"This is a crime thriller that’s been a long time in the making. Mystery fans rejoice: ‘Knives Out’ is an impeccable cinematic achievement, laced with sardonic wit, division and conflict, and of course a perplexing puzzle. This is easily one of the most fun films of 2019 - it’s both a brilliant piece of entertainment and beautifully crafted enigma. Sit back, relax, and try to crack the code.

298,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

Knives Out has been shown in numerous festivals, and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them. Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can’t deny that I was indeed affected by the whole “a whodunnit like you haven’t seen in years.” I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It’s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a “bad” movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn’t, he did other stuff, you know?). It’s one of those films everyone knows it’s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.

Even the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole “best X of the decade,” I’m going one step beyond). This is a film I know I’m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who “did it,” the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn’t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.

This screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell’s). It’s been half-a-day since I’ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there’s an answer lying on someone’s words or actions. It’s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it’s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.

I genuinely love the first act, even if it’s the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn’t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It’s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn’t, then it does again…

That’s one of the reasons I couldn’t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel “intellectually superior” just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time’s up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, “I guessed it,” there’s a 99% chance that they’re either lying or not answering correctly to the question “who killed Harlan?” If you’ve seen the movie, you’ll understand what I’m trying to express.

(I don’t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I’m not trying to say, “I couldn’t figure it out, so no one can.” Please, if you haven’t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)

Throughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera’s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.

However, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I’ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I’m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he’s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it’s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.

My only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It’s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell’s Jacob and Katherine Langford’s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act’s interrogatories. It’s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.

In the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I’ve ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he’s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess “who did it” beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It’s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don’t miss it!

299,60,Review from Gimly,"I did not think that _Last Jedi_ was a very good movie, but I have always been a fan of Rian Johnson. And honestly? _Knives Out_ is a strong contender for his best work yet.

300,84,Review from Matthew Brady,"“This case is like a donut
with a hole
in the middle of a donut hole.
Actually,
it's a donut within a donut's hole.”

‘Knives Out’ subverted my expectations...in a good way. A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.

Rian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he’s a great director and writer. He’s also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting.

One of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery/comedy.

The cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig’s Southern drawl which I didn’t expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from ‘House of Cards’. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles.

Dose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth’s ‘Knock Knock’? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can’t lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it.

Chris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he’s a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable.

The rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else ‘Knives Out’ has to offer.

Toni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She’s uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died.

Judging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There’s an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.

Overall rating: My House. My Rules. My Coffee!!!",135,2020-01-27 18:30:23,2021-06-23 15:58:33
301,64,Review from ahmedaiman99,"""That certainly not what I was expecting.""

- Whodunit?
- Rian Johnson.
- Why?
- To subvert the tropes of yet another sub-genre... properly!

As divisive as it was, I neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it The Last Jedi. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.

In Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.

Not only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an ""Anti-Captain America ""; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!

Overall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes! Excuse me, I gotta leave right now!

307,1,Review from Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/it-was-just-an-accident-review/

""It Was Just an Accident is a testament to the unwavering courage of Jafar Panahi, a filmmaker who refuses to be silenced.

It's a brave protest executed as a psychological thriller that, despite occasionally stumbling in its own need to be overtly political — with the message sometimes delivered too directly — manages, in its conclusion, to transcend its narrative and raise moral questions that are difficult to ignore.

An intense and intrepid invitation to confront the inconvenient truth that, under an oppressive regime, the line between justice and fatality is often drawn by chance.""

308,22,Review from Brent Marchant,"The desire for vengeance is indisputably a toxic force, one that can lead us to engage in unspeakable acts whose despicable nature is often on par with the wrongs committed against us. Consequently, we can’t help but ask ourselves if this is an acceptable, justifiable course. What’s more, no matter how much we may wish to seek retribution, are we truly capable of following through on such acts, especially if we can genuinely appreciate the harm those heinous deeds may have had on us? Those are the thorny questions raised in this latest offering from acclaimed Iranian writer-director Jafar Panahi, showing us how a simple mishap can spiral out of control, creating a chain reaction of problems that grows progressively difficult to contain. What begins as a minor traffic accident involving Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi), a young husband and father, quickly snowballs into a progressively dangerous, intricately complicated scenario in which he’s unexpectedly spotted by Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), a onetime-persecuted Azerbaijani dissident who believes that Eghbal is the Iranian government intelligence officer responsible for having tortured him while in captivity. But is he? Vahid is uncertain, but he nevertheless avails himself of the opportunity to kidnap the suspected culprit, threatening to bury Eghbal alive to get his revenge. However, as Vahid zealously digs Eghbal’s grave, he pleads with the kidnapper that he has the wrong man. Given his nagging uncertainty, Vahid gives his victim a reprieve, holding him hostage while trying to definitively prove his identity. This sets off a series of both perilous and surprisingly comical incidents involving other former radicals (Mariam Afshari, Hadis Pakbatan, Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr), all of whom struggle to determine whether the suspect is who Vahid contends. And, as this increasingly madcap situation plays out, additional complications arise that prompt Vahid and his peers to question if they can carry out this dubious venture. Having been on the receiving end of monstrous state-sponsored treatment allegedly at the hands of their captive, they wonder whether they can impose the same kinds of atrocities on him that had been thrust upon them. Their compassion and humanity gradually rise to the surface, increasing their hesitancy. Then they also wonder what would happen to them if Eghbal’s claims of innocence prove correct? The filmmaker skillfully wrestles with both sides of these questions and does so in ways that successfully combine gut-wrenching drama, chilling moments of terror, and inspired, masterfully implemented episodes of comic relief. These strengths aside, however, the narrative occasionally gets bogged down in overly talky sequences (especially in the overlong closing act), but, given Panahi’s long personal history of censorship, harassment and arrest by Iranian authorities, this is understandable. In fact, given the courageous but controversial views expressed herein, in some ways, I find it hard to fathom how this film got made in the first place. Nevertheless, for his efforts, the filmmaker has been deservedly rewarded with some prestigious accolades, including the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. Ironically, much of what has transpired in Iran over the past 75 years feels akin to the metaphor driving this story, an ongoing series of unfortunate events in which the stakes are continually upped with each passing incident. Yet, those similarities aside, as fitting as the film’s themes and title might thus seem, chalking up everyday real world matters to being “just an accident” comes up distressingly short in describing what has actually gone on in Iran. Perhaps it takes an uncomfortably distressing fable like this to help us see what can happen when we let our impulses get the better of us – and to realize that some things we might attribute to mere accidents are, in the end, nothing of the kind.",654,2025-11-03 13:59:34,2025-11-03 14:03:29
309,139,Review from ohlalipop,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew that this would attract a lot of attention. Of course having Leonardo in the lead role helped a lot. 


From the trailer, I already know some things. Dreams. All about dreams. But what about dreams? Who are the other people? At first, I didn't really understand what was going on. It was all very confusing to me. But as the movie progresses, I start to understand it and I wanted to watch some more and know more what will happen in the end. The ending. That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.

311,140,Review from Varya,"Is there anyone on earth who doesn't like Christopher Nolan’s films? Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.

The film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.

There are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.

The only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.

A curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.",139,2019-10-17 06:15:57,2021-06-23 15:58:28
312,84,Review from Matthew Brady,"Ariadne: ""Why is it so important to dream?""

Cobb: ""Because, in my dreams we are together.""

I haven't seen this movie in years, but after re-watching it struck me hard how depressing this was.

Putting aside the action sequences and loud music and a complicate plot, there's a beautiful story about a man trying to get back to his children, without it being cheesy. Well if you really break this movie at it's core, it's about two grieving men (Leo and Murphy), both haunted by the past until they have the strength to accept reality and let them go.

The 'Grow Old Together' scene stuck with me the most.

You can say whatever you want about Christopher Nolan, but his movies are never hollow. I'm also convince that Nolan would be the perfect choice to direct a James Bond movie.

Seriously, throughout the whole movie I was thinking ""Man imagine the genius behind Inception directing a Bond movie"". The ingredients are right there.",348,2020-01-27 18:16:34,2021-06-23 15:58:33

  <p>At its core, ""Inception"" follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled extractor who can infiltrate people's dreams to steal information. Cobb is offered a chance at redemption and a way back to his children through one last job: planting an idea in someone's mind, a process known as inception. This seemingly impossible task involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in both the dream world and filmmaking itself. The intricate plot weaves together elements of heist movies, psychological thrillers, and mind-bending science fiction, creating a narrative tapestry that is as complex as it is captivating.</p>

Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals perfectly, adding layers of tension and emotion to every scene. The technical prowess displayed in ""Inception"" sets a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking, seamlessly blending practical effects with CGI to create a world that feels both fantastical and tangible.</p>

  <h2>Legacy and Impact: A Dream That Lingers</h2>
  <p>Since its release, ""Inception"" has sparked countless discussions and debates, particularly regarding its ambiguous ending. This open-ended conclusion invites viewers to question the nature of reality and the power of perception, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll. The film's influence can be seen in subsequent movies that explore similar themes of reality versus illusion.

317,67,Review from MustachedMovieMan,"I don't really get what all the negative reviews are about.
It's not the best movie ever or that I've seen this year, but I still had a good time watching it. The story was interesting, it had some scary parts, some humorous parts, lots of tension, was well-acted, well-shot, and the effects (both practical and CGI) were well-done. Also, the production design and creature design was great.

A movie doesn't have to be restricted to either being ""the best"" or ""horrible."" The theater I saw it in was packed, the audience was responsive and seemed to be loving it, and I myself enjoyed it.

I didn't really play the games, but I was definitely engaged in the lore of some of the MatPat Game Theory videos I saw. And I could tell from audience reactions that there were some cool things in the movie if you knew the games. That's not a negative, to be clear. It's always really cool when filmmakers put things in movies that true fans would catch and geek-out about.

As far as being a viewer who didn't really play the games, I enjoyed the movie. And while I think knowing the games/lore would have definitely enhanced my enjoyment and enthusiasm, I wouldn't say it lacks as a movie or that the games are ""required viewing"" for those who haven't played them. Everything's explained pretty well.

As far as the horror aspect goes, it is PG-13; I saw some reviews complaining about the lack of gore... It's PG-13. C'mon guys.
But, that being said, I thought they still did a good job with the horror elements that were present.

I also really liked the trio of main characters. I thought Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio, and Elizabeth Lail all did a good job.
Also, I'm glad Josh Hutcherson is back. I hope he'll continue to be in more movies.",219,2023-10-27 19:10:26,2023-11-01 16:19:08
318,6,Review from CinemaSerf,"Didn't Josh Hutcherson used to be famous? Well here he is reduced to the role of the struggling brother of ""Abby"" (Piper Rubio). Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so ""Mike"" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer ""Vanessa"" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take ""Abby"" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of ""Mike"" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.",101,2023-11-02 09:34:31,2023-11-02 09:34:31

323,146,Review from tmdb47940942,"I have been a fan of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise for 9 years, and I can say that this was a good adaptation for the video game. I give it 3.5 stars or 7/10 because I have watched many interviews with Emma Tammi and some YouTubers were able to release BTS footage a week or so early. Those interviews and BTS videos really helped me understand the love and care Blumhouse, Scott Cawthon Productions, and Jim Henson's put into the world that they all knew so many loved. But I wouldn't go any higher than 3.5 or 7/10 because there were not that many jump scares or good scares. It got me a few times, but not as many as I wished for. and they didn't show much of William or the Spring Bonnie suit. William Afton is the villain of this franchise. In every universe FNaF has, there is a William, and he kills, and I feel like they swung and missed the ball with William a little. If they are able to make a second film, I hope they explore William more. This is a fun watch, good for fans of the franchise, and a good beginner movie for people who get too scared watching horror movies.",14,2024-02-12 19:18:48,2024-02-14 20:22:27
324,147,Review from ViolettSmith,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a fun bad film. I personally loved it. I've waited years for it to hit the big screen, and I can't believe the day came. To get this out of the way, Jim Henson's company did a fantastic job bringing the animatronic horrors to life. All the animatronic suits look phenomenal; it looks like they ripped them straight from the game. The Easter egg characters also looked really good. Jim Henson's done an awesome job! The actors for the film were great as well: Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and Matthew Lillard. All great actors that fit their roles perfectly. I am a little sad that Matthew Lillard's role, William Afton, didn't have that much screen time. For being the main villain of the whole film, he only had a big twist at the end. Speaking of the big twist, Matthew Lillard played William Afton perfectly; I can't imagine someone else playing the role. He tuned into who William Afton was so well. The line ""I always come back"" didn't really fit; at that moment, how does he know he will come back? The lack of scares in the film and the fact that Mr. Cupcake gets the most kills in the whole film are insane to me. FNaF is a jumpscare game, and this film focused more on the human story, which is fine; I would've liked more than a few jumpscares. I also don't care for the animatronics being all friendly; their kids are trapped in robots. Unless those kids were born killing, I can't see how people can be mad at the animatronics for being friendly.",325,2024-02-13 01:40:37,2024-02-14 20:23:28
325,13,Review from r96sk,"Serviceable.

I feel like more could've been done with the mascots via the animatronics as well as giving them each some sorta creepy voice, though this is of course based on a video game so if that's how they are in the game (which I've never played nor heard of) then I guess this is not a valid 'criticism'. Just as a film, I think that would've made it more lively.

<em>'Five Nights at Freddy’s'</em>, as it is, is a passable supernatural horror. Josh Hutcherson does an acceptable job as lead, as Elizabeth Lail and youngster Piper Rubio do well too. More could've perhaps been done with Matthew Lillard's character, though Lillard is himself is alright.

Evidently, the reception to this 2023 movie has been mixed, I can tell that from both the average rating chart and from those that I follow. It worked for me, that's all there really is for me to say.",728,2024-09-15 23:35:55,2024-09-15 23:35:55
